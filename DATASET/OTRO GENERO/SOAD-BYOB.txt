Why do they always send the poor?

Barbarisms by Barbaras
With pointed heels
Victorious, victories kneel
For brand new spankin' deals
Marching forward hypocritic
And hypnotic computers

You depend on our protection
Yet you feed us lies from the table cloth

La, la la, la la, la la, la la

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Kneeling roses disappearing
Into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox
Stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil
Crying, "Freedom!"

Handed to obsoletion
Still you feed us lies from the table cloth

La, la la, la la, la la, la la

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Blast off. It's party time
And we don't live in a Fascist nation
Blast off. It's party time
And where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?

Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

Kneeling roses disappearing
Into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox
Stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil
Crying, "Freedom!"

Handed to obsoletion
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth

La, la la, la la, la la, la la

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sun

Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
They always send the poor
They always send the poor
