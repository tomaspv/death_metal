1. I'll Never Grow Up, Now!
[words, music: D. Snider]

They say:
Hey whaddaya doin' with your life
Why don'tcha settle down and find yourself a wife
Don'tcha know you can't run away from here
When will you act your age, why don'tcha listen dear

I say:
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up, now

They say:
You better stop your dreamin', you're goin' nowhere fast
What if we throw you out, how long you think you'll last
When will you go to school, why don'tcha get a job
Hey girl you better shape up, you're looking like a slob

Well I say:
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up, now
And I say it again
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up, now

I can't believe you can't hear what you're saying
Take a good look at yourself
Why don'tcha you listen to the music we're playing
Go pick on somebody else

[Solo - Eddie]

They say:
You think that life's a free ride, well take a tip from me
We're gonna end your party with some responsibility

I say:
I'll never grow up (ha ha ha ha)
I'll never grow up (oh)
I'll never grow up, now
(Alright but you can do better than that, everybody sing)
I'll never grow up (come on)
I'll never grow up (come on)
I'll never grow up, now
(Go, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)
I'll never grow up (hey you in the back, yeah you)
I'll never grow up (don't you stand there, sing along)
I'll never grow up, now
I'll never grow up (grow up now)
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up, now (yippee, I want my mother)
I'll never grow up
I'll never grow up (what are these people doing in my room)
I'll never grow up, now (get off of my bed, I gotcha, I gotcha in my dresser)
I'll never grow up (what's happening?)
I'll never grow up (?)
I'll never grow up, now

2. Under The Blade
[words, music: D. Snider]

A glint of steel, a flash of light
You know you're not going home tonight
Be it jack or switch, doctor's or mind
Nowhere to run, everywhere you'll find
You can't escape from the bed you've made
When your time has come, you'll accept the blade!

You're cornered in the alley way, you know you're all alone
You know it's gonna end this way, the chill goes to the bone
Now here it comes that glistening light, it goes into your side
Blackness comes, tonight's the night, blade is gonna ride

[CHORUS:]

Cause you're under the blade
Oh, you're under the blade

It's not another party head, this time you cannot rise
Your hands are tied, your legs are strapped, a light shines in your eye
You faintly see a razor's edge, you open your mouth to cry
You know you can't, it's over now, blade is gonna ride

[REPEAT CHORUS]

[Solo - Jay Jay]

A glint of steel, a flash of light
You know you're not going home tonight
Be it jack or switch, doctor's or mind
There nowhere to run, everywhere you'll find
You can't escape from the bed you've made
When your time has come, you'll accept the blade!

You've tried to make it to the front, now you're pinned against the side
A monster stands before you now, its mouth is open wide
The lights go on, the night explodes, it tears into your mind
When the night does end, you'll come again, the blade is gonna ride

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Here it comes, baby
Ow!

Now you're under it
You're going down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down

Hey!
Ow!

1. What You Don't Know (Sure Can Hurt You)
GOOD EVENING! WELCOME TO OUR SHOW
IF YOU'VE GOT THAT PROBLEM
WELL I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THIS AIN'T THE SAME OLD STORY
OR THE SAME OLD SONG AND DANCE
DON'T SPEAK OF FADED GLORY
'CAUSE YOU WON'T GET A SECOND CHANCE
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING

CAUSE THERE'S A DIAMOND IN THIS DUST
HIT IT! WE'RE NO OVERNIGHT SENSATION
NO CINDERELLA FANTASY
PLEASE NO PLAUDITS OR OVATIONS 
I'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE YOU SEE

WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW SURE CAN HURT YOU
WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE MAKES YOU SCREAM
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW SURE CAN HURT YOU
WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE IS WHAT YOU DREAM

AIN'T WE A PRETTY PICTURE?
AIN'T WE A LOAD OF FUN?
DON'T LET ME INFLUENCE YOU
I'LL DO THAT WHEN WE'RE DONE
OH, ARE WE IRRITATING?
OH, ARE WE GRATING ON YOUR NERVES?
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT THE GOOD BOYS 
NEVER GET WHAT THEY DESERVE

WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW SURE CAN HURT YOU
WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE MAKES YOU SCREAM
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW SURE CAN HURT YOU
WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE IS WHAT YOU DREAM

YOUR BRAIN IS FILLED WITH QUESTIONS
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHY
DON'T LOOK TO ME FOR ANSWERS, HONEY
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LIE

HOW DO YOU LIKE IT SO FAR?

WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW SURE CAN HURT YOU
WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE MAKES YOU SCREAM
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW SURE CAN HURT YOU

2. Shoot 'Em Down
COME ON BOYS!

NO ONE EVER GETS HER
OH AIN'T SHE COOL

SHOOT 'EM DOWN, SHOOT 'EM DOWN
SHOOT 'EM DOWN, SHOOT 'EM DOWN
SHOOT 'EM DOWN, SHOOT 'EM DOWN

3. Under The Blade
A GLINT OF STEEL
A FLASH OF LIGHT
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT
BE IT JACK OR SWITCH
DOCTOR'S OR MIND
NOWHERE TO RUN, EVERYWHERE YOU'LL FIND
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
FROM THE BED YOU'VE MADE
WHEN YOUR TIME HAS COME, YOU'LL ACCEPT THE BLADE!

YOU'RE CORNERED IN THE ALLEY WAY
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALL ALONE
YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA END THIS WAY
THE CHILL GOES TO THE BONE
NOW HERE IT COMES THAT GLISTENING LIGHT
IT GOES INTO YOUR SIDE
THE BLACKNESS COMES
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT
THE BLADE IS GONNA RIDE

'CAUSE YOU'RE UNDER THE BLADE
OHHH
YOU'RE UNDER THE BLADE

IT'S NOT ANOTHER PARTY HEAD
THIS TIME YOU CANNOT RISE
YOUR HANDS ARE TIED, YOUR LEGS ARE STRAPPED
A LIGHT SHINES IN YOUR EYES
YOU FAINTLY SEE A RAZOR'S EDGE
YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH TO CRY
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T
IT'S OVER NOW
THE BLADE IS GONNA RIDE

'CAUSE YOU'RE UNDER THE BLADE
OHHH
YOU'RE UNDER THE BLADE 

A GLINT OF STEEL
A FLASH OF LIGHT
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME TONIGHT
BE IT JACK OR SWITCH
DOCTOR'S OR MIND
NOWHERE TO RUN, EVERYWHERE YOU'LL FIND
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
FROM THE BED YOU'VE MADE
WHEN YOUR TIME HAS COME, YOU'LL ACCEPT THE BLADE!

YOU'VE TRIED TO MAKE IT TO THE FRONT
YOU'RE PINNED AGAINST THE SIDE
A MONSTER STANDS BEFORE YOU NOW
ITS MOUTH IS OPEN WIDE
THE LIGHTS GO ON, THE NIGHT EXPLODES
IT TEARS INTO YOUR MIND
WHEN THE NIGHT DOES END, YOU'LL COME AGAIN
THE BLADE IS GONNA RIDE

'CAUSE YOU'RE UNDER THE BLADE
OHHH
YOU'RE UNDER THE BLADE
HERE IT COMES BABY
WHOAAAAAAAHHHH...
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN, DOWN, DOWN,

4. Leader Of The Pack
Hey, is he really goin' out with her?
Well, there he is, let's ask him
Hey Dee, is that your ring Suzie's wearin'?
Uh huh
Man, it must be great ridin' with her
Are you pickin' her up after school today?
Uh huh
By the way, where'd you meet her?
I met her at the candy store
She turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture?
Yeah, we see
That's when she fell for

The leader of the pack

Her folks were always putting me down (down, down)
They said I came from the wrong side of town (they said he came from the wrong side of town)
They told her that I was bad but she knew I was sad
That's why she fell for

The leader of the pack

One day her dad said find someone new
She had to tell me that we were through (whatcha do when he said that you better go find somebody new)
I stood there and asked her why but all she could do was cry
"I'm sorry I hurt you"

The leader of the pack

She was so small
As she kissed me goodbye her tears were beginning to show
And as she drove away on that rainy night I begged her to go slow
If she heard I'll never know
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no (look out, look out, look out, look out)

I felt so helpless, what could I do?
Remembering all the things we'd been through
The gang they all stop and stare, I can't hide my tears but I don't care
I'll never forget her

The leader of the pack

Leader of the pack
And now she's gone [18x]

1. Never Say Never (2002 Re-recording)
Hello, it's me again, the thing that wouldn't die
You thought you had me beaten, now you can't deny
No woman fire and it's hard and time to burn
They see liars there and lyin' they take your turn

No no no never, no never
No never say never again

Why did you waste your time on those who don't deserve
No nothing, parasite or get your guarded there
Well, now you're lookin' at the illustrated goon
I've got two words for you that can't be misunderstood

No no no never, no never
No never say never again

No no no never, no never
No never say never again

Hey, I think you never thought you'd have to face the noise
A nice paid back up friend was being all the voice
And now you're prayin' you got peace and do not fail
But you'll be goin' to the steamin' iron hell

No no no never, no never
No never say never again

No no no never, no never
No never say never again

2. Blasting Fast And Loud (2001 Re-recording)
We're on a roll, won't be denied
We've been to hell, we're back, our metal has been tried
We're driving hard, foot down the gas
This is our final road, our word will be the last

We're blastin', fast and loud
Blastin', fast and loud
And we're gonna sing it loud, yeah, we're gonna sing it proud
Blastin', fast and loud

Some things in life you've got to choose
Like were you born to win or are you born to lose
You've got one chance, don't let it go
Let total domination be your final goal

We're blastin', fast and loud
Blastin', fast and loud
And we're gonna sing it loud, yeah, we're gonna sing it proud
Blastin', fast and loud

We're blastin', fast and loud
Blastin', fast and loud
And we're gonna sing it loud, yeah, we're gonna sing it proud
Blastin', fast and loud

Well, we're on a roll, won't be denied
We've been to hell, we're back, our metal has been tried
We're driving hard, foot down the gas
This is our final road, our word will be the last

We're blastin', fast and loud
Blastin', fast and loud
Yeah, we're gonna sing it loud, yeah, we're gonna scream it loud
Blastin', fast and loud
Yeah, we're gonna sing it loud, yeah, we're gonna scream it proud
Blastin', fast and loud

3. Follow Me (Live)
Oh no, here we go, doin' it all over again
Paintin' our lips and shakin' our heads, we gotta find a new bunch of friends
You know it's good to be here, burnin' you're tryin' to get here so
So get up your seat, you're lookin' sweet and shake to some old rock 'n' roll

Lookin' at you, I can see right through your eyes
You got the power to love, you float in the skies

Follow me when your heart is breakin'
And your body's shakin'
And your whole world's achin'

Oh my, we will dye, every thought that you really know
Just what goes on when I'm closin' our guard and we're thinkin' of somethin' to do
Well out in a pink, that I can drink so much and I'd be aware
So turn out the light and kiss me goodnight, I really didn't need you there

Lookin' at you, I can see right through your eyes
You got the power to love, you float in the skies

Follow me when your heart is breakin'
And your body's shakin'
And your whole world's achin'

4. Under The Blade (Live)
A glint of steel, a flash of light
You know you're not going home tonight
Be it jack or switch, doctor's or mind
Nowhere to run, everywhere you'll find
You can't escape from the bed you've made
When your time has come, you'll accept the blade!

You're cornered in the alley way, you know you're all alone
You know it's gonna end this way, the chill goes to the bone
Now here it comes that glistening light, it goes into your side
Blackness comes, tonight's the night, blade is gonna ride

Cause you're under the blade
Oh, you're under the blade

It's not another party head, this time you cannot rise
Your hands are tied, your legs are strapped, a light shines in your eye
You faintly see a razor's edge, you open your mouth to cry
You know you can't, it's over now, blade is gonna ride

5. Lady's Boy (Live)
So, you need the service of a man
I can do what any grown man can
Oh, you think I look like a little boy
Don't be fooled, I've got a deadly toy

I'm a lady's boy and I'm a bundle of joy
Well, I'm a wayward child, I'm a lonely boy

Now listen here
Flesh and hot, my wares aren't hard to sell
See my hips, I sure can use 'em well
You want me to fill your mind's desire
Submission and love will douse your fire

I'm a lady's boy and I'm a bundle of joy
Well, I'm a wayward child, I'm a lonely boy
A lady's boy and I'm a bundle of joy
Well, I'm a thing of love, I'm a deadly toy

Aah, so good

Oh, you think I'm far too young to do
I will show you things you never knew
I see you squirm, your palms begin to sweat
Don't resist, you'll love it hot and wet
Feel my power to put you in a whirl
Oh, woman maybe, to me you're just a girl

I'm a lady's boy and I'm a bundle of joy
Well, I'm a wayward child, I'm a lonely boy
A lady's boy and I'm a bundle of joy
Well, I'm a thing of love, I'm a deadly toy

A deadly toy, a deadly toy, aah

Aah, Won't you come up and see me some time?

6. Come Back (Live)
One, two, three, four

Well, after all the times we met, you said I never was your man
And though I tried hard to forget, I never quite could understand
And when I finally realize all the things you meant to me
You were gone away, leaving everything to me

So would you come back, would you come back to me
So would you come back, you mean everything to me
So would you come back, would you come back to me

Walkin' back the games we played, opening up those unlocked doors
Remembering all the love we made, always wanted to make more
And if I had it all again, I'd do it all again for free
'Cause now you've gone away, now there's nothing left for me

So would you come back, would you come back to me
So would you come back, you mean everything to me
So would you come back, would you come back to me

[Solo: Jay Jay]

You stupid fool, look what you've done, now I'm alone
Now I'm the one, you didn't care but only lied, so here I stand
And now I'm cryin', oh come back, come back to me
Come back, come, come back to me, oh yeah

And as the hours turn to years, I sit here thinking of the days
I need to wipe away the tears and all the things I want to say
And as I finally dry my eyes and as I turn to walk away
I took my head up to the sky, fell then upon my knees and pray

So would you come back, would you come back to me
So would you come back, you mean everything to me
So would you come back, so would you come back to me

So would you come back, so would you come back to me, yeah
So would you come back, you mean everything to me, yeah
Would you come back, would you come back to me

Oh, would you come back, would you, would you come back to me
Oh, na na na na, oh, na na na, yeah
Oh, would you come back, would you, would you come back to... me, yeah

7. Can't Stand Still (Live)
Well, I remember the day that it ended, it was a scene that I never intended
My heart just hasn't been mended from that day on
You looked at me so sadly, you said I treated you badly
You said you want something madly, but now it's gone

Well baby, when, when, when I was in a rock 'n' roll band and I was playin' a one night stand
And I said I wanna be your man and it was fine
But 'til you said that we hadn't made it, although so invaded
The situation is jaded and it's a crime

And don't you know that I just can't stand still for a minute, too many memories ended
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, I gotta move
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, too many memories ended
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, I gotta move, oh, go go Eddie, go

Well, you know that I just can't stand still for a minute, baby, too many memories ended
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, I got to move
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, oh no no, too many memories ended
Oh, I just can't stand still for a minute, I gotta move

Well, I always been a warm warm ember for my love that I always remember
You know it ended and bleed out December, I'll never forget, no I'll never forget
Because I know deep down in my soul, there's a feelin' that I'll never control
I'll just keep playin' my rock 'n' roll and I'll make it there

Well, you know that I just can't stand still for a minute, too many memories ended
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, I got to move
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute, baby, too many memories ended
Oh, I just can't stand still for a minute, I got to move
Oh, I just can't stand still for a minute, I got to move
Well, I just can't stand still for a minute
Baby, well, why you treat me so bad, I can't stand it anymore
Pack all my bags and get the hell outta town, yeah

8. Honey, Look Three Times (Live)
Who's that boy comin' down the street
Stoppin' strange, it's good enough to eat
The girls all turned their pants to set on fire
Then one thud, they've only one desire

Well, honey look twice, honey look three times
You got the reason, I got the rhyme
Well, honey look twice, honey look three more times

Listen here
There's somethin' special 'bout the way he walks
There's somethin' sexy 'bout the way he talks
There's somethin' crazy 'bout the clothes he wears
There's somethin' magic 'bout that hairdo hair

Well, honey look twice, honey look three times
I pay the hook honey, pull my line
Well, honey look twice, honey look three more times

The girls all shoutin' honey, what's your name
He smiles and knows they'll never be the same
His eyes they call you but you know they'll lie
Without a baby, you just know you'll die

Well, honey look twice, honey look three times
You're the law, I'm the crime
Well, honey look twice, honey look three more times, oh yeah

Let it rock

He'll tell you everything you wanna hear
But come tomorrow, you won't find him near
Because he's gone much faster than he came
And then it hits you, can't recall his name

Well, honey look twice, honey look three times
You want me baby, I pry
Well, honey look twice, honey look three times
I'm the six, you're the nine
Well, honey look twice, honey look three more times, oh yeah

9. You Know I Cry (Live)
So many times you move me
When I know you really care
When I'm with you things are all right
I know that you'll be there

But I can't let you walk out that door
I can't let you just say goodbye
And I can't let you walk out that door
I can't let you, you know I cry, I cry

I waited for a lifetime
For what I got today
Don't change mind late at night time
Don't throw it all away

But I can't let you walk out that door
I can't let you just say goodbye
And I can't let you walk out that door
I can't let you, you know I cry, I cry

The years we spent together feel done right from the start
Now I won't just change a minute, I've torn it all apart
I find it hard to hold it, hour makes it how I feel
I wanted just to hold you, so corny isn't real

But I can't let you walk out that door
I can't let you just say goodbye
And I can't let you walk out that door
I can't let you, you know I cry, I cry

10. Without You (Live)
Can't you see it's all around you
Just open up your silly eyes
It's in the air and everythin' I do
And all those things that think I lied

Well, I don't wanna wait, so please don't hesitate
Without you, I can't live a day
Without you, there's no need to stay
Without you, I don't wanna this way without

Now lookie here, don't bother tryin' to hide
You know I'll find you anyway
Through all the years of stickin' by your side
So don't you talk, I won't hear what you say

Well, I don't wanna wait, so please don't entertain
Without you, I can't live a day
Without you, there's no need to stay
Without you, I don't wanna this way without

You run and run, you never stop at all
You say you're never feel at home
Well, don't you worry, I won't let you fall
You're by yourself but you are not alone

I have to find a way, because you got to stay
Without you, I can't live a day
Without you, there's no need to stay
Without you, I don't want it this way without you
Without you, without you, without you

11. Plastic Money (Live)
I'm livin' on the edge, I'm pushin' all the way
Don't worry 'bout a thing, some other sunny day
I'm barely touchin' ground and I'm runnin' hard and fast
I'm pullin' all the strings and I'm sayin' it's the last

Take away my plastic money
Keep away from plastic money
Well, don't you play with plastic money
I'm only payin' all tabs away with plastic money

I'm playin' with everythin' and I'm lookin' all around
I just can't understand but this is what I've found
They catalystically intoxicate your mind
A computerized assault but who commits the crime

Take away that plastic money
Keep away from plastic money
Don't you play with plastic money
I'm only payin' all tabs away with plastic money

They blow away your dreams with a single decimal point
If you fight the powers that be, you'll wind up in the joint
I just begin to see as the Antichrist arrives
Where we're headed for as we charge away our lives

Take away that plastic money
Keep away from plastic money
Well, don't you play with plastic money
I'm only payin' all tabs away with plastic money

Oh honey, plastic money

12. Long Tall Sally (Live)
I'm gonna tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John
She says she was too busy to have a lot of fun
Oh baby, yeah, now baby
Oh, now baby, I'm gonna have some fun tonight

Well, I saw Uncle John with long tall Sally
He saw Aunt Mary comin' so he jumped back in the alley
Oh baby, yeah, now baby
Oh, now baby, I'm gonna have some fun tonight

Well, long tall Sally, she's pretty as you please
She does me real good when she gets down on her knees
Oh baby, yeah, now sugar
Oh, now baby, I'm gonna have some fun tonight

I'm gonna have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Oh, everything's alright
I'm gonna have some fun tonight
I'm gonna have some fun, have some fun tonight

13. Johnny B. Goode (Live)
[Chuck Berry cover]

Way down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Never ever learned to read or write so well
Play a guitar like a ringin' a bell

Go go, go Johnny
Go go, go Johnny
Go go, go Johnny
Go go, go Johnny
Go go, yeah Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Sit beneath the tree and play all day
Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made
People passed him by, used to stop and say
My, how that little country boy could play

Go go, go Johnny
Go go, go Johnny
Go go, go Johnny
Go go, go Johnny
Go go, yeah Johnny B. Goode

Well, his mama told him someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a kick ass band
Many people comin' from miles around
Hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe some day your name will be in lights
Johnny B. Goode tonight, I said

Go go, go Johnny
Go go, go Johnny
Go go, go Johnny
Go go, go Johnny
Go go, yeah Johnny B. Goode
