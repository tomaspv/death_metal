1. Heeding The Call
A flash in the night, a journey through time
the Templars are back on the streets
Guarded by prowess and the will to survive
all led by the guiding light
Angels of mercy, guardians of time
Shackled and chained through the eternal flame
the hammer will slowly arise

Heeding The Call, one and for all
never surrender, with glory we'll fall
Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight
fulfilling our fate, we are Heeding The Call

One, step ahead, revealing the past
united, together we stand
The call of the thunder, the sign to begin
this final crusade we will win

Angels of mercy, our journey must proceed
With hearts all filled up with chivalry
the lifeblood that we all need

Heeding The Call, one and for all
never surrender, with glory we'll fall
Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight
fulfilling our fate, we are Heeding The Call

Oh, oh, oh...

Heeding The Call, one and for all
never surrender, with glory we'll fall
Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight
fulfilling our fate, we are Heeding The Call

2. Legacy Of Kings
Out in the fields
the full moon is rising
Enlightens the name on our shields
blessed with pride
Steel on our side
we're horsemen of thunder
The ground starts to shake as we ride
side by side
Stormbringer led us into the unknown
On wings of glory we will carry on
Legacy Of Kings - LEGACY OF KINGS
forever to surrvive, we're
Riding on the winds - RIDING ON THE WINDS
unchained and free, alive forevermore
Deep in the night
we circle around them
The honor compels us to fight
all for one
All hewed with steel
in the toil of the battle
Our enemies fate will reveal
and be sealed
The chill of the wind keeps on calling our names
there's no turning back now, keep hold of the flame
Legacy Of Kings - LEGACY OF KINGS
forever to surrvive, we're
Riding on the winds - RIDING ON THE WINDS
unchained and free, alive forevermore
Now we are here
and there is nothing left to fear
The secrets of steel
the path of glory will reveal
Legacy Of Kings - LEGACY OF KINGS
forever to surrvive, we're
Riding on the winds - RIDING ON THE WINDS
unchained and free, alive forevermore

3. Let The Hammer Fall
It's getting closer now
the clock strikes midnight time
It is the tolling of the judgement bell
You fear the dead of night
there ain't no place to hide
This is your point of no return
Now we are ready to strike, again
It's getting far to late, my friend
Let The Hammer Fall
We are above the law
let our power show
That we're in full control of your destiny
Now we are ready to strike, again
It's getting far to late, my friend
Let The Hammer Fall
Oh [x32]
We're getting closer now
the chill of distant eyes
Your on a dead end street into the night
Now we are ready to strike, again
It's getting far to late, my friend
Let The Hammer Fall
Let the Hammer... FALL

4. Dreamland
See the light of those who find
as time pass you by, you're still left behind
Time has come for you to see
that life is a game you'd rather play or flee
The ivory gates cast shadows, might betray
surrender this night, or choose my way
Come with me, I'll take you there
to the land of make belive
Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie
On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty
with the power of the steel
with the power of the steel
with the power of the steel
Dreamland will reveal
All you see is black or white
you have to spell out what's wrong or right
Spoken words may have let you down
it's time to stand up and rise with the sun
You entered the gates and there's nothing left to fear
but don't let the matter stand, you're near
Come with me, I'll take you there
to the land of make belive
Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie
On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty
with the power of the steel
with the power of the steel
with the power of the steel
Dreamland will reveal
Let me know if you wanna go, there's a place for you and me
Let me take you to the temple of your heart, let me know
You entered the gates and there's nothing left to fear
but don't let the matter stand, you're near
Come with me, I'll take you there
to the land of make belive
Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie
On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty
with the power of the steel
with the power of the steel
with the power of the steel
Dreamland will reveal

5. Remember Yesterday
Can you tell me why
it seems so hard to carry on
When you hear a voice
from long ago, so bittersweet
Even though I try, I can not
read between the lines
You know I tried,
Oh, yes, I tried, what's wrong
Too late to turn back time
To look over my shoulder
Maybe one day I'll return again
Remember Yesterday
and think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday
don't leave me with the sorrow
Cause I have to live today
Every morning I awake
to see the newborn day
To carry on the flame
until the end of time
Too late to turn back time
To look over my shoulder
Maybe one day I'll return again
Remember Yesterday
and think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday
don't leave me with the sorrow
Cause I have to live today
Oh, oh, oh, don't you step aside
and pretend about the future
Oh, oh, oh, never live a lie
don't you know tomorrow never comes
Remember Yesterday
and think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday
don't leave me with the sorrow
Cause I have to live today
Oh, oh, oh, don't you step aside
and pretend about the future
Oh, oh, oh, never live a lie
don't you know tomorrow never comes

6. At The End Of The Rainbow
As long as I remember
we've marched across this land
oh, oh ...
Reached for a new horizon
pulled by the killing hand
oh, oh ...
All fed up with lies
the time has come
to break these chains and fly
Here we stand, bound forevermore
we're out of this world, until the end
Here we are, mighty, glorious
At The End Of The Rainbow
with gold in our hands
We know the treasure lies
beyond the pouring rain
oh, oh ...
Our quest will last forever
for you it's all the same
oh, oh ...
No one can deny
our future's set
to reach above the sky
Here we stand, bound forevermore
we're out of this world, until the end
Here we are, mighty, glorious
At The End Of The Rainbow
with gold in our hands
Let's fly away through the rain
fly high, to ease the burning pain
oh, the colours fading out
The light is shining in the night
it's up to you, it's worth the fight
search before the colours fade
Here we stand bound forevermore
we're out of this world, until the end
Here we are, mighty, glorious
At The End Of The Rainbow
with gold in our hands

7. Back To Back
They came at dawn into the morning light
black shadows riding on the mist
Prepered for battle, swords were shining bright
filled with anger and harm
Came to kill not to charm
The sound of metal screaming in the air
the time has come were justice rules
The endless victims looking up in fear
Now, who are the fools
Oh, here they come, riders of the sun
And they will fight ... Back To Back
They're fighting hard, their way to victory
dead bodies lying on the ground
They are the soldiers of eternity
and their swords spinning around
Oh, here they come, riders of the sun
And they will fight ... Back To Back
Kill with power, ready to ride, let's go
They got it all, they'll never fall
But they will fight
The night is falling, light will disappear
a magic silence fills the place
Could read the warning, shining crystal clear
now they were lost for the chase
Oh, here they come, riders of the sun
And they will fight ... Back To Back
No, no, no ,no

8. Stronger Than All
Always standing proud, we know our time has come
marching off to war, the crusade has just begun
Fighting for the right to live under the sun
we won't stop 'til they've lost and we've won
Come and fly with us, together as one we belong
This magic of metal unites us, it's making us strong
Like an arrow we strike  -  STRONGER THAN ALL
heavy metal troops on the rise
Like an arrow of might  -  STRONGER THAN ALL
We'll walk through fire, we're true to ourselves and our lives
History commits the oath to deal in steel
Warriors of the Faith, to no living soul we kneel
Born into the fold, the Templars are for real
no one will ever bring us to heel
Come and fly with us, together as one we belong
this magic of metal unites us, it's making us strong
Like an arrow we strike - STRONGER THAN ALL
shooting through the air at full speed
Like an arrow of might - STRONGER THAN ALL
in the name of metal, defending our hopes and beliefs
The past and the present unites in us all, we stand up for our beliefs
The way of the Templars is here once again, forever they will be free
Like an arrow we strike - STRONGER THAN ALL
heavy metal troops on the rise
Like an arrow of might - STRONGER THAN ALL
We'll walk through fire, we're true to ourselves
Like an arrow we strike - STRONGER THAN ALL
shooting through the air at full speed
Like an arrow of might - STRONGER THAN ALL
in the name of metal, defending our hopes and beliefs

9. Warriors Of Faith
They search the desert plains
in the land of no return
To seek out the danger, time to burn
They are the rightous ones
they've come to claim this land
Like warriors under command
They fight for gold and glory
proclaim the dead man's land
Into the dungeons they must go
to find the answers, left untold
Under the burning sun
in danger, eye to eye
They all now that someone must die
Into the well they're falling
past immortality
Led by temptation and devotion
rendered deathless by the touch of the sword
Onwards victory, let us hear your battle cry
the enemies, will renounce or die
Hail the Warriors Of Faith
Together they march through the fire
Forever they're lost in this world
Onwards victory, let us hear your battle cry
the enemies, will renounce or die
Eternally, they will fall under the sign
of victory, fighting all for one
Hail the the Warriors Of Faith

10. The Fallen One
I saw your face in the morning sun
oh, I thought you were there
I heard your voice as the wind passed me by
silently, whispering my name
So many things that I wanted to say
forever left untold
I still remember the tears that you shed
over someone else
Our love could never die
all I can do is cry
save a little prayer for the fallen one
There is a light down at memory lane
slowly fading away
Still holding on to the dreams torn apart
I will follow my heart
Our love could never die
all I can do is cry
save a little prayer for the fallen one
Still on my own, chasing the sun
of a time long ago
The shade in my heart, tearing apart
everything that I long for
I saw your face in the morning sun
oh, I thought you were there
I heard your voice as the wind passed me by
whispering my name
Our love could never die
all I can do is cry
save a little prayer for the fallen one

***************************

1. I Want Out
[Original By Helloween]

From our lives' beginning on
We are pushed in little forms
No one asks us how we like to be
In school they teach you what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see

[Bridge:]
So they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this

[Chorus:]
I want out - to live my life alone
I want out - leave me be
I want out - to do things on my own
I want out - to live my life and to be free

People tell me A and B
They tell me how I have to see
Things that I have seen already clear
So they push me then from side to side
They're pushing me from black to white
They're pushing 'til there's nothing more to hear

[Bridge:]
But don't push me to the maximum
Shut your mouth and take it home
'cause I decide the way things gonna be

[Chorus:]
I want out - to live my life alone
I want out - leave me be
I want out - to do things on my own
I want out - to live my life and to be free

There's a million ways to see the things in life
A million ways to be the fool
In the end of it, none of us is right
Sometimes we need to be alone

[Solo: Kai / Both]

No no no, leave me alone

[Chorus:]
I want out - to live my life alone
I want out - leave me be
I want out - to do things on my own
I want out - to live my life and to be free

2. At The End Of The Rainbow
As long as I remember
We've marched across this land
Oh, oh...
Reached for a new horizon
Pulled by the killing hand
Oh, oh...
All fed up with lies
The time has come
To break these chains and fly
Here we stand, bound forevermore
We're out of this world, until the end
Here we are, mighty, glorious
At The End Of The Rainbow
With gold in our hands
We know the treasure lies
Beyond the pouring rain
Oh, oh...
Our quest will last forever
For you it's all the same
Oh, oh...
No one can deny
Our future's set
To reach above the sky
Here we stand, bound forevermore
We're out of this world, until the end
Here we are, mighty, glorious
At The End Of The Rainbow
With gold in our hands
Let's fly away through the rain
Fly high, to ease the burning pain
Oh, the colours fading out
The light is shining in the night
It's up to you, it's worth the fight
Search before the colours fade
Here we stand bound forevermore
We're out of this world, until the end
Here we are, mighty, glorious
At The End Of The Rainbow
With gold in our hands

3. Man On The Silver Mountain
[Original By Rainbow]

I�m a wheel, I�m a wheel
I can roll, I can feel
And you can�t stop me turning
�cause I�m the sun, I�m the sun
I can move, I can run
But you�ll never stop me burning

[*]
Come down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someone�s screaming my name
Come and make me holy again
I�m the man on the silver mountain
I�m the man on the silver mountain

I�m the day, I�m the day
I can show you the way
And look I�m right beside you
I�m the night, I�m the night
I�m the dark and the light
With eyes that see inside you

[* x2]

Just look at me and listen
I�m the man, the man, give you my hand
Come down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
I�m the man on the silver mountain
I�m the man on the silver mountain
I�m the night the light
The black and the white
The man on the Silver Mountain

1. Templars Of Steel
The hands of time have brought you here
to make a change, to break down the walls
You are the ones and you are the only
trying to live by your own goals

And you all cry for freedom
Raise your fists to the sky

Let your voice speak for the revolution
All join forces with all the powers that you feel
Let your heart beat for the revolution
Led by the Templars of Steel

Let's spread the word of the sole survivors
with metal pounding inside their souls
The fire burns, and it will forever
blaze for the ones who stands strong

And you all cry for freedom
with your fists in the sky

Let your voice speak for the revolution
All join forces with all the powers that you feel
Let your heart beat for the revolution
Led by the Templars of Steel
You are the Templars of Steel

Oh, oh, oh ...

Let your voice speak for the revolution
All join forces with all the powers that you feel
Let your heart beat for the revolution
Led by the Templars of Steel

Let your voice speak for the revolution
All join forces with all the powers that you feel
Let your heart beat for the revolution
Led by the Templars of Steel
You are the Templars of Steel

2. Keep The Flame Burning
Standing at the
crossroads, were the future meets the past
Oh can't you feel, there's magic in the air
We're noble knights and mighty men, with the
power to assay
Faithful and true, let our deeds show you the way

Glorious, we live and we die
Our courage will unite

In our hands we hold the future, carry on
In our hearts, eternally, we Keep The Flame
Burning

Hear the sound of roaring thunder, and the sound of raging steel
In the battle of thrust our sprits will reveal

Glorious, we'd rather die
with honour than to live with shame

In our hands we hold the future, carry on
In our hearts, eternally, we keep the flame...
burning deep inside forever, shining on
And in our hearts for all eternity we Keep The
Flame Burning

We stay as we are, now the first crusade is won
Let it be written, let it be done

In our hands we hold the future, carry on
In our hearts, eternally, we keep the flame...
burning deep inside forever, shining on
And in our hearts for all eternity we Keep The
Flame Burning

3. Renegade
See the outlaw stands alone beneath the burning sun
The raging badlands now is his home
There's no sign of victory, he lost his liberty
and the only woman that he loved

An outlaw chasing outlaws, a runner in the night
By the radiant moon he will strike
The seeker of all dangers has come to take his toll
From the dead of night he will arise

Renegade, Renegade
Committed the ultimate sin
Renegade, Renegade
This time the prowler will win

He stalks in shadow lands, soundless, with gun in hand
Striking like a reptile, so fierce
No chance to get away, no time for your last prayer
When the prowler sneaks up from behind

An outlaw chasing outlaws, the hunter takes his pray
The law of the jungle he obeys
Craving for the danger to even out the scores
Face to face, once and for all

Renegade, renegade
Committed the ultimate sin
Renegade, renegade
This time the prowler will win

On through the night he rides, on his raging
horse made of steel
Nothing can save you now, before the renegade
you will kneel

Renegade, Renegade
Committed the ultimate sin
Renegade, renegade
This time the prowler will win

Renegade, Renegade
Committed the ultimate sin
Renegade, renegade
This time the prowler will win

4. Living In Victory
Do you remember how we used to say
Everything around us are made of clay
We were the Kings and the others the fools,
playing by our rules

Adorned with golden shapes and silver dreams
You count the seconds, every moment seems
like your lost to the stars up above
Eventhou you're falling

Spoken words made of trust, burning bridges
between us,
turning diamonds into rust

You're running out of time, the higher that you climb
the deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all
Out of time, on the line
Living In Victory

You spread your words, I say devoid of truth
What's left is fantasy of endless youth
You made a promise, a little white lie
Now you're falling from the sky

Chasing dragons by the moon, burning bridges around you,
your deepest fears begin to loom

You're running out of time, the higher that you climb
the deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all
Out of time, on the line
Living In Victory

Is it someone that hears you, is it somebody there
All you know and all you will get, lie so deep
down inside

Dreams of fortune in the dust, when all your
bridges are burnt,
turning being into lust

You're running out of time, the higher that you climb
the deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all
Out of time, on the line
Living in sin

Out of time, the higher that you climb
the deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all
Out of time, on the line
Living In Victory
Living In Victory

5. Always Will Be
Our sun is set, our day is done, I'm left here wondering
Is this the end, my final words to you
Day turned to night and now you're gone, I'm left
here pondering
Can this be true, are we really through

You were the wind beneath my wings, taught me
how to fly
With you I lived among the kings, how could this
ever die

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever,
and I Always Will Be

We were one, we were all, we were the only
Future full of hope, nothing could stand in our way
But dreams can change, visions fall, I feel so lonely
I would walk through fire for just one more day

You were the angel of my life, taught me to be free
Now I'm a stranger in your eyes, walls are
closing in on me

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I Always Will Be
Missing you, in my heart you are The One
And you Always Will Be

When I turn to the east, I see no dawn,
but after darkness comes the light
And when I turn to the west, the silent night hides all
Where is the light that shines so bright

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I Always Will Be
Missing you, in my heart you are The One
And you Always Will Be

Nah-nah-na ... and you Always Will Be
Nah-nah-na ... and you Always Will Be
And you Always Will Be
my Little One you are
And you Always Will Be

6. The Way Of The Warrior
Our time has come, get ready fight
Sisters and brothers in metal unite
The dreams that you had are about to come true
The voice of the warrior is calling for you

Turn your own deeds to his gracious glory,
and he will make you see

This is the way we want it to be
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way we want it to be
Walking the way, the honest will see
Walking The Way Of The Warrior
Walking the way, The Way Of The Warrior

Blood-red the steel of our swords shall flow
and by the allegiance we're ready to go
Stout are the foe, in warfare so bold
Nothing can stop us, the future we hold

Brace up, defend,
never ever be outdone in bravery

This is the way we want it to be
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way we want it to be
Walking the way, the honest will see
Walking The Way Of The Warrior
Walking the way, The Way Of The Warrior

The saints and the sinners in battle so bright, as
the forces of steel will unite
The way of the warrior, the call of his life, shall
lead us all into the light

The metal crusade will conquer all
Our bonds will be stronger, see the infidels fall
Surrender your soul to the Gods of steel
In the blood of the fallen the enemies kneel

Turn your own deeds to his gracious glory,
and he will make you see
Brace up, defend,
never ever be outdone in bravery

This is the way we want it to be
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way we want it to be
Walking the way, the honest will see
Walking The Way Of The Warrior
Walking the way, The Way Of The Warrior

This is the way we want it
This is the way we need it
This is The Way Of The Warrior

This is the way we want it
This is the way we need it
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way

7. Destined For Glory
Once upon a time in a forlorn land,
a man on a mission was left at fates hand
In his eyes you could see the whites turn red
Surrounded by evil, abandoned for dead

Born on the run by the sign of the sun
A mail-clad warrior, the chosen one
His name's been cursed, he is bound to fail
A wandering spirit with the will to prevail

By the sign of the moon,
he swore the oath to fight alone

Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without honor, and you're destined to
fall

He still can recall his father's words
"Don't loose your faith, let your voice be heard"
Echoes from the past will lead him on
By these words of honor, shine like the sun

By the sign of the moon
He swore the oath to fight alone

Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without honor, and you're destined to
fall
Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without soul and you will loose it all

The prophecies spoke of a wandering man
Skilled with steel, black as the night

Normally veiled from the mortal eyes
His hammer arose like a magic force
With a gaze that turned everything into stone
the warrior spoke, "I am the one"

Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without honor, and you're destined to
fall
Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without soul and you will loose it all

Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without honor, and you're destined to
fall
Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without soul and you will loose it all

8. The Champion
Gaze upon the stake,
flames will soon start to embrace
Condemned, auto da fé,
she's about to fall from grace

In the land of the rising sun
shadows are falling again
The die is cast, the future and past
coming to her at last

Oh, oh, oh
All she needed was a Champion
Oh, oh, oh
Crying for a saviour to fight for her life

Behold, the freedom cries
by the dying of the light
Too late to justify
for vindication upon this night

In the land of the rising sun
shadows are falling again
From out of nowhere, a rider declared
to answer her final prayer

Oh, oh, oh
He stood up to be the Champion
Oh, oh, oh
He became the saviour that fought for her life

Face to face, eye to eye
The saviour fought to save her pride
Far beyond the starlit skies, the encounter went
on

Gaze upon the stake,
as the flames start to embrace
A life, an act of faith,
long-lost gone without a trace

In the land of the rising sun
Shadows are falling again
The die is cast for the future and past
came for her at last

Oh, oh, oh
All she needed was a Champion
Oh, oh, oh
Crying for a saviour to fight for her

Oh, oh, oh
He stood up to be the Champion
Oh, oh, oh
He became the saviour that fought for her life

9. Raise The Hammer
[INSTRUMENTAL]

10. A Legend Reborn
You've been fighting for much to long
You saw the future and what to come
Restless spirits out on the run,
among the shadows of the sun

You are the rising resistance now
We've come to show you a way somehow
Beyond the past and in secrecy,
we found it all, but we want more

We come from the age of chivalry
Metal machines, unchained and free
We are hear for you to see

Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are
breaking the seal
Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the
word of a Legend Reborn

Moving silent like a gentle breeze
We're the troops of metal and we do as we
please
We are the restless, we are the wild,
burning hearts that never die

We are going against the tide
The hammer has fallen, a thorn in your side
Break the silence or take the fall
The mighty Templars will take it all

Welcome the age of chivalry,
were we all will be set free
It's the time for you and me

Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are
breaking the seal
Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the
word of a Legend Reborn

Sons and brothers fight or fall
With our sisters and daughters
We're standing one for all

Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are
breaking the seal
Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the
word of a Legend Reborn

Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are
breaking the seal
Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the
word of a Legend Reborn
