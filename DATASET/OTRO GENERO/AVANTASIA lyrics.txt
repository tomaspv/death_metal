1. Prelude
[instrumental]

2. Reach Out For The Light
[Gabriel]
Lord above - why don't you tell me
why I'm here in agony?
I've been serving, I've been praying
now I'm caught in misery.

I've been praised by friar Jakob,
I misused his confidence.
Cheated by this work of evil - 
feigning Anna's innocence.

Oh what have I done?
So many ways lead to the fallen one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Oh what have I done?
What is going on?

We should bring salvation,
not give in to his temptation - no!
Read and preach the holy world
and no forbidden lies that hurt.
I remember words of "seven".
Set me bree - sanity!

[Lugaid]
Reach out for the light
far beyond confines.
You have read the magic lines
leading to the light in your mind...

[Gabriel]
What is right and what is wrong now?
Is it a trial of paradise?

Is anna a witch or do they stick to an error?
What's the book and the seal inside?

Am I a cleric or maybe a sinner? 
Unbeliever? Renegade?
Was it the devil who led me to "seven"?
Oh redeemer is it all too late?

Oh, what have I done?
I have been led by the smelling one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Tell me stranger, what have I done?
Oh what's going on?

We should bring salvation,
not give in to his temptation - no!
Read and preach the holy world
and no forbidden lies that hurt.
I remember words of "seven".
Set me free - sanity!

[Lugaid]
Reach out for the light
far beyond confines.
You have read the magic lines
leading to the light in your mind...

[Gabriel]
In your mind?

3. Serpents In Paradise
[Gabriel]
Reading the madness they took her away
under the cross.
Bailiff and bishop and monk -
Malleus Maleficarum - the law

Prayed for salvetion, I fought for her soul -
scared by the horned.
The devil was creeping around
until she died in the flames as he saw.

Father forgive me for I've hardly seen
the human deep within. Just an intention -
so holy and clear - paving the way to madness
for us...

Serpents on the way to paradise -
dying for love, fighting for ages.
Serpents on their way to paradise -
raging with anger and pain for the cross.

[Jakob]
Father forgive me for what I have done.
For I betrayed the one that I loved like a son.
Demons and spells are they reality?

The pest and the schism; the power of the Moor
We've got to fight. Keep our people afraid...
Keep them away from what they shall not see.

I see a menace to our paradise
in these evil times.
Heaves is burning, people are yearning
for a new doctrine, they are...

[Gabriel]
Serpents on the way paradise.

[Jakob]
Don't know they'll end in final damnation.

[Gabriel]
Serpents on the way to paradise...

[Jakob]
Raging with anger and pain against the cross.

[Gabriel]
Lord if I'm an unbeliever - what do I believe?
Can you tell me lord what you had done
if you were me?
I have stared into the eyes
of innocence and fear.
I saw Anna in the tower in a lake of tears.
Something strange is going on and
still I don't know why.
I have stared into the secrets
they still try to hide.

Vandroiy can you tell me what you know about it all?
Vandroiy can you help me
to leave this prison hall?
Vandroiy can you help me
free Anna from the chain?
Vandroiy can you help me
to become a little sane?

Serpents on the way to paradise -
Dying for love, fighting for ages.
Serpents on their way to paradise
Raging with anger and pain...

4. Malleus Maleficarum
[Falk von Kronberg]
So, daughter of the old evil spirit, you still pretend
you don't know? Maybe we have a way to make you remember...

[Else Vogler]
I have done no wrong, blood shall come upon you!

[Falk von Kronberg]
Torturer, pull on!

5. Breaking Away
[Lugaid]
Don't wait my friend. We better don't think twice.
Time to fell the prison guard you gotta realize:
No turning back again. Therefor it's all too late...
New horizons wait...

I know the time has come
te leave your past behind.
And now the time has come
to stop them controlling your mind.

[Gabriel]
Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away.
Otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away!
Oh - otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Always been a novice in quest for paradise.
Hope they will forgive me for I apostatize.
I can't be no hypocrite, can't wear a masquerade...
New horizons wait...

[Lugaid and Gabriel]
And now the time has come to go another way.
To learn for life and to grow ripe
and prevent the decay...

[Gabriel]
Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away.
Otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away!
Oh - otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Breaking away!
It is so hard to lay down what I've been.
But I must go even if my way leads to Hades...

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away.
Otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

Breaking away!
All we can do now is break away!
Oh - otherwise she will be dying
while both of us are lying here in chains.

6. Farewell
[Gabriel]
Days had come, winters had gone,
and we gamboled like siblings in Paradise.
I was your knight, holding you tight
as a brother when I saw your crying eyes.
Time went by and we had to say goodbye.

Staring up to the clouds above
Children - so little and sad.
Hoping the saints could help one day
Lead us together again.
Holding the key to the alley of dreams
still in hands.

Time telling me to say farewell
but I knew that I would fight hell
and I knew: We will
go for another time we can see,
for another time we'll be free,
for no more farewell.

[Anna]
Stepbrother tell me where have you been
when they brought me to this godforsaken place.
Sign of the cross - they took me away
for healing with herbs by the way of grace.
Now I wait for the day to feed the flames.

[Gabriel]
I have been caught in a cage of despair.
My heart as a monk's cell so empty and bare.
But no holy water can make me
forget you again...

Time telling me to say farewell
but I knew that I would fight hell
and I knew: We will
go for another time we can see,
for another time we'll be free,
for no more farewell.

[Lugaid]
No farewell could be the last one.
If you long to meet again...

7. The Glory Of Rome
[Falk]
Jesus Christ I'm coming - terrestrial home.
I'm allowed to guide their train
to visit you in Rome.
I am sick of preachers telling to be plain
while you got it nice in here.
They'd better feel ashamed.

[Johann Adam von Bicken]
Oh, ways of gold
lead is into Your blaze of fame.
Oh, are You waiting
for what we have brought You from hell?

[Gabriel]
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Praising the king of the kings.
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Reaching for haloes and wings.

[Johann Adam von Bicken]
Heading for the angels, heading for the feast,
heading for salvation and the ruin of the beast.
Let us fight the outcast, let us brin 'em fire,
let us lock the center of their wicked, mad desire.

Oh, ways of gold lead us into Your blaze of fame.
Oh, are You waiting
for what we have brought You from hell?

[Gabriel]
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Praising the king of the kings.
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Reaching for haloes and wings.

[Pope Clemens IIX]
Holding in my hand: Seven parts of a seal
to unlock the land of illumination I feel.
And it's been foretold: after touching the light
we shall lock the world.
But now it's our time to transcend,
the ultimate key in our hand.

[Gabriel]
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Praising the king of the kings.
Glory of Rome, glorious home.
Reaching for haloes and wings.

8. In Nomine Patris
[instrumental]

9. Avantasia
[Gabriel]
Open my eyes
and see my bleeding wounded hands...
Feeling the pain too hard to stand. To stand...
Caught in the 'now and here'
while they are on the way.
Hiding imagination, leading us astray...

[Lugaid]
Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind.
Sanity can be the toll -
leading to the core of your soul.

[Gabriel and the voices in his head]
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy.
We are the kingdom of light and dreams,
gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy.
We are the kingdom of light and dreams,
gnosis and life: Avantasia! - Avantasia...

Walking along the icy gallery of pain.
Tell me now: What can keep the flame alive?
Lack of imagination - raising up the tower
where they hold our souls
to take away the tower.

[Lugaid]
Use your mind!
You will leave the flesh dimensions behind.
Sanity can be the toll -
leading to the core of your soul.

[Gabriel]
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy.
We are the kingdom of light and dreams,
gnosis and life: Avantasia!
We are the power inside, we bring you fantasy.
We are the kingdom of light and dreams,
gnosis and life: Avantasia!

Oh - Avantasia
Oh - I hear the voices
Oh - into the light
Oh - Avantasia...

10. A New Dimension
[instrumental]

11. Inside
[Elderane]
We're the little creatures
deep inside your mind.

[Regrin]
Some call us their fantasy
but some to never find.

[Elderane]
We can teach philosophy
but still we must commend...

[Regrin]
The state of our existence
right into your hand
Welcome to this place in here come overstep all your fears...

[Gabriel]
Where have you all been once
when I was alone?
When I was a hero in their crazy wicked show
you've sent no little spark
into my darkened view of life.
Did not make me ask for what is wrong
and what is right.

And still I regret to be here.
I'm dreaming of Anna in tears.

Inside - so deep inside
you will die if I don't dream anymore?
Inside - so deep inside
you will die if I don't dream anymore?

12. Sign Of The Cross
[Gabriel]
From a world of reign they come...

[Pope]
In a world of mammon we have found it all!
Fighting for pride and for gold.
But the key to the reign, to the ultimate control:
wisdom of the old.

We have been elect to drain the wine
of Gnosis to hide it and pray.
Got to save our children from the beast.
We are on the way.

[Elderane]
Remaining in darkness
the land of salvation will drown.
And when we'll have vanished
slavery will take your freedom down.

[Gabriel]
Seven eyes to be blind forever in time:
Sign of the cross...
Hell arise! Castigation under the sign,
sign of the cross - make us drown in altar wine.

[Bishop von Bicken]
In the heart of justice called Horeb long ago
Moses got carvings in stone.
Imposed to judge those who do not fear
the only, the holy, the lord.

[Gabriel]
The blood of anger and pain:
Ink of the Old Testament.
I know they'll end their crusade,
drown in the blood of the lamb.

[Elderane]
Remaining in darkness
the land of salvation will drown.
And when we'll have vanished
slavery will take your freedom down.

[Gabriel]
Seven eyes to be blind forever in time:
Sign of the cross...
Hell arise! Castigation under the sign,
sign of the cross - make us drown in altar wine.

[Regrin]
You have been the chosen one,
so welcome to this place.
Vandroiy's told us you would come
to help us win the race.
Bring back the seal from the men
who don't know what they do.
Seemed to be a fool without and own way of life.
But you've been a sleeping mind
and you woke up on time.
You've got the power to save us and finally you.

[Gabriel]
A dream is forever.
The land of salvation can't drown.
These enchanting colors -
who could have the might to tear it down?
(all these colors - fantasy...)

Seven eyes to be blind forever in time:
Sign of the cross...
Hell arise! Castigation under the sign,
sign of the cross - make us drown in altar wine.

13. The Tower
[Gabriel]
Where do I go?

Never had a very real dream before.
Now I got a vision of an open door.
Guiding me home, where I belong,
dreamland I have come.

Oh where do I go?

Never had a flesh and blood like this before.
Got a new appearance when I passed the door.
Is it a dream I am withing? Oh what's going on?

Down, down, down
Go down, go down, go down
I roam into nowhere.
Don't see an end: eternal wastelands.
And I hear the voice, the voice, the voice, the voice...

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Never been a fighter, never been a man.
But I must help Vandroiy, he's my only friend.
Nowhere to go and I know that he knows how
we will get her out...

Magic of transcendence
brought me to this place
A Vandroiy in reality lead me on my race.
Told me to bring back the seal
but still I don't know where I shall go.

[Lugaid]
Can't you 'feel' the voice?
You don't have a choice.
What a kind of life:
Freedom in flesh - shackles on your mind...

Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
For all the wisdom of ages doesn't die.

[Elderane]
Men have good intentions
on their way to the light.
But some of them are venal
and end up in the night.
Maybe it's better for you, mankind,
not to know what's going on.

[Gabriel]
Sometimes we must go
ways that seem to be wrong.
What a kind of life: Freedom in flesh,
shackles on your mind...

[Lugaid]
Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the name of the one
who reigns from inside...

[Voice in the Tower]
You have come the long way through ages
to bring me the seven parts of the seal.
So now throw it over the walls of the tower.
Throw the seal!

[Pope]
But first Godfather, what about the prophecy? What
about your reward: The ultimate illumination, the
gnosis and the power to defend your kingdom on
earth with a strong hand? What about the prophecy?

[Lugaid]
I realize...

[all]
For the glory, for the glory, for the glory,
For the glory. Oh - what is going on?
For the glory, for the glory, for the glory,
For the glory. Oh - what is going on?

[Lugaid]
Gabriel I can feel:
You have it back - book and seal.
Still no war is won, we have just begun...

Go all the way to the tower!
Long for the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Found out the name of the one
who reigns from inside...

Go all the way to the tower!
Long for the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Found out the name of the one,
Of the one...

[Jakob]
Oh, how could the stranger steal the seal away?
Was it my fault? Or was it no one's fault at all?

*************************************

1. Lost In Space
Another star
has fallen without a sound
Another spark
has burned out in the cold

Another door
to barrens standing open

And who is there
to tell me not to give and not to go

How could I know? how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know? how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

I'm crawling down
The doorway to the badlands
And kicking down

Are you heard: it's to the black
and all the damage
fading in the oblivion mirror
When the demons
are calling me, their dragging me away

How could I know?, how could I know?
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever

How could I know?, how could I see?
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Lost in space
lost in time
Lost in space
Lost in Time
Lost in Space

How could I know, how could i know
How could I know, How could I know
That I'll get lost in space to roam for ever

How could I now, how could I see
feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Forever...

2. Lay All Your Love On Me
[ABBA Cover]

I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every man I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up man should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think it was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

3. Another Angel Down
[feat. Jorn Lande]

I am the master of the game
that s made a fool you
I m watching from the highest tower
You got the aura to enchant them - and a symphony
And I have got the power

You better taste - they call it life: my special area
I m breeding winners over there
Ain't it a sin to turn your back
on what you re given
It s time to take your share

God left me for dead - I've been turning my head
Away from the living - the time has come
To gamble for gain - To tear down the gate
And see what's inside

We rock the ball
Been smashed to the ground
Arose from devotion
To take a look and see what is inside
Sight of the crown: Another angel down
We rock the ball
I m facing my pain
With a rage and a symphony
Driven by the wounds I cannot hide
Rise above the crowd: another angel down

We ll see a black hole will be left up in the starry sky
We gotta mourn another angel
If I am just a light descending to caducity
It s still so far away

There s no tomorrow
I don t remember yesterday
I m just living for tonight
And all the love I m not gonna waste no more
I won t spit what s divine

They left you for dead - turning your head
Away form the living - from flesh and blood
You've got the draw and desire to claw
For fortune and fame

We rock the ball
Been smashed to the ground
Arose from devotion
To take a look and see what is inside
Sight of the crown: Another angel down
We rock the ball
I m facing my pain
With a rage and a symphony
Driven by the wounds I cannot hide
Rise above the crowd: another angel down

4. The Story Ain't Over
[feat. Bob Catley & Amanda Somerville]

Rousing from dreams, craving for someone
Wept himself to sleep
He s waiting for a sign from above
Where is the love

The hourglass in pieces, dashed to the wall
The future is over
Tomorrow's been slipping away
And nothing remains

He'd known it won't last forever
She'd go ahead for a while

When you open your eyes
When you gaze at the sky
When you look to the stars
As they shut down the night
You know this story ain't over

When you open your eyes
When you gaze at the sky
When you look to the stars
As they shut down the night
You feel this story ain't over

Where is the candle in this lonesome night?
Angle why are you so wayward
Abandoning me, try my belief

When life is not words
and tongue is not answers
And we only can t see a reason
Why would it mean
that it's not meant to be

He'd known it won't last forever
She d go ahead for a while

When you open your eyes
When you gaze at the sky
When you look to the stars
As they shut down the night
You know this story ain't over

When you open your eyes
When you gaze at the sky
When you look to the stars
As they shut down the night
You feel this story ain't over

5. Return To Avantasia
[Instrumental]

6. Ride The Sky
[Lucifer's Friend cover]

[feat. Eric Singer]

Traveling this dark world, leaving light behind
seeing things I shouldn't see
new eyes I got to find
Mars Venus and stars shaking
their heads at me
No more today's - tonight I'll be riding the sky

Hey world look out I'm coming
Friends pass me by and you saw me humming
Mars Venus and stars shaking
their heads at me
No more today's - tonight I'll be riding the sky
Tonight ride the sky, tonight ride the sky

The smile on his face turn me to stone
The words that he spoke
wouldn't leave me alone
Mars Venus and stars
shaking their heads at me
No more today's tonight I'll be riding the sky
Tonight ride the sky, tonight ride the sky,

Tonight ride the sky
Tonight ride the sky...

****************************

1. Ghost In The Moon
Ghost in the moonlight
Throw your veil upon these grounds
Cold! The night is star-bright
Pale is all beauty of your gown

Dark, frame a fire!
Mystery of a blood red rose
Dark! Shine sapphire!
You won't leave me on my own

Raised my head above the haze
I woke up to a world
I feel almost humanized
Tender loving all around
Apparently profound
Through self-deceitful eyes

Now what am I supposed to be
For sure it can't be me
In orderly array
My, it's feeling so unreal
How daunting to be free
In the light of day

Lost in this world - with no place to go

Awaiting the night to yell a prayer up to the starlight
Veiling boon: Ghost in the moon
Grant me admission tonight
Into your tenebrous wicked star-bright golden gloom:
Ghost in the moon

Whispers sounding from the brake
Sinister eyes along the way
A phantom rushing through the night
Make haste, run from the dawn
Back across the Rubicon
To the shelter from the light

Before the sun is gonna rise
To reflect it in their eyes
A sight no one's gonna stand
Oh your blood is gonna freeze
Different blood: a different breed
No one's gonna comprehend

They teach you love, they make you belong...
Suck you in to spit you out, the rage is on...

Awaiting the night to yell a prayer up to the starlight
Veiling boon - Ghost in the moon
Grant me admission tonight
Into your tenebrous wicked star-bright golden gloom:
Ghost in the moon

Like a rushing thunder
You're a shade in the swampland
And a Trojan horse they'd rowel into your dreams
They chase you into dawn
To a silken bed of quicksand
Rush, so you can breathe, they'll give you up
You're in my world past remedy

Asking, wondering, look at me: waiting... prompting...
I may be drawn to something
That I can't phrase for you
Even though it's true

I won't be what they long to see in me
No matter how desperately they reach out for me
A sedating hand

They don't understand, I don't comprehend
I can't take no more of their shallow light
Burning me inside
Then I am better off a scorn in the night

I am rumour, I am nightmare
That I'm bound to dream myself
Half human - and it's frightening -
To just guess the other half

I'm a misfit on a journey and I'm afraid my destiny
Has been sealed right from the outset:
To immure the real me
I'll wane in this world
Just me and the glow of the moon - yeah wow

For the chill of the night is gonna summon a fire
A strange world on the brink, or a maniacal dream?
Dead matter alive - heart, soul and desire
Rise from the smoke and the fire -
From maniacal dreams
Crucible-born and unseen -
Megalo-maniacal dream
Megalo-maniacal dream

To chase the...
Ghost in the moonglow
Throw your gown upon the light
Ghost in the moonglow
Whisper from the starlit skies

Dark - frame a fire
Mystery of a blood red rose
Moon - spark a fire
You won't leave me on my own

2. Book Of Shallows
What if I would script a dream?
And if I'd let you in?
I'd be your door out of a stark truth...

Leave a stark reality
An arrant giveness
I'd make you fall to be there for you

Let Morpheus commit his spark
To a stray soul wandering
Errant in the dark

Chase your dream!
If you don't mind don't be astounded
By the things they make you do
For amusement's sake
Chase your dream!
When all comes breaking down around it
What a day for a pastel dream
That's coming to life...

Beautiful in colour
United in their creed
Reasonable people dreaming ordinary dreams

Rise above confusion
And leverage the weak
Dive into the shuffle
And then tap into the freak show

And Morpheus commits his spark
To a plain soul wandering, errant in the dark

Chase your dream!
If you don't mind don't be astounded
By the things they make you do
For amusement's sake
Chase your dream!
When all comes breaking down around it
What a day for a pastel dream
That's coming to life...

May it charm the living
May it ease misgiving
Intoxicating, dazing
Rapture of the shallow
Dazed and captured

Say you wanna be now
Sneak into their dream now
Suck up to their love
You're the master of their freakshow
Give into temptation
Seek and bring salvation
Mine now, Suburbia!
Tomorrow it's the nation

Wait for a savior
Rising from the tranquil sea
The book of shallows
Bringing forth a common dream

Going with the grain
Numb the pain
We are common sense
Knock them down a peg
Make them beg for deliverance
Rapture of the deep, they believe
Take a deep bow
Give them what they need now
Mingle with the creep show

Going with the grain
Numb the pain
We are common sense
Knock them down a peg
Make them beg for deliverance
Rapture of the deep, they believe
Take a deep bow
Give them what they need now
Mingle with the creep show

Wait for a savior
Rising from the tranquil sea
The book of shallows
Bringing forth a common dream

Let Morpheus commit his spark
To a stray soul wandering in the dark

Chase your dream!
If you don't mind don't be astounded
By the things they make you do
For amusement's sake

Chase your dream
When all comes breaking down around it
What a day for a pastel dream
That's goin' to plan

Chase your dream!
If you don't mind don't be astounded
By the things they make you do
For amusement's sake

Chase your dream
When all comes breaking down around it
What a day for a pastel dream
That's goin' to plan
What a day for a pastel dream
That's goin' to plan

3. Moonglow
Such a beautiful light to undo what I thought I believed in
Wild and cold is the wind that’ll blow my conviction away

Hear the call of the bright moon above
Outside of your window
Would you follow me into a world
Where reason doesn’t pertain

Everything I’ve come to know is gonna fall to pieces
Everything you’ve come to dream is gonna turn out real

A lunar light into your room
Let it carry you into the night
Moonglow ~ let it take you away

The road aflame ~ fooling gravity ~ you follow the light
Moonglow, Moonglow to the other side

All you’re told to comprehend
And put in place and understand
Is gone in the enchanting magic light

Follow me into the night to a place by the willow
Leave all your schemes and patterns of thinking behind
And I dream how I rise
As I look down on the shelf on a pillow
And I know I won’t try to explain
What I’ve seen in this night

Everything you’ve come to know is gonna fall to pieces
Everything I’ve come to dream is gonna turn out real

A lunar light…
A lunar flight into your room
Let it carry you into the night
Moonglow ~ let it take you away

The road aflame ~ fooling gravity ~ you follow the light
Moonglow, Moonglow ~ to the other side

Oh ~ Will you take me over
Take me over
World in the moonglow

Make me feel
This is real
A face in the moonglow

A lunar light into your room
Let it carry you into the night
Moonglow ~ let it take you away

The road aflame ~ fooling gravity ~ you follow the light
Moonglow, Moonglow ~ to the other side
All you’re told to comprehend
And put in place and understand is gone

4. The Raven Child
[Hansi Kürsch:]
Wild groves, sacred grounds fade to vastness
Mother Moon, cast your spell on these fields
Let the boughs paint ghostly shades on the trail
To a different world

[Tobias Sammet:]
Where castle looks out to a valley
Where I'm given all the love that I crave
Not afraid of the rising sun laying bare my brittle soul

[Hansi Kürsch:]
Cold is the wind
Bringing forth clarity
Time rushing on
And nothing will remain
There's no glory on the last journey home...

[Tobias Sammet:]
Looking down from this pure cope of heaven
Onto an ocean of white that drowns
All the noise and decree
And the craze in empty eyes

Wide-eyed I'm lost in my imagination:
A dream of love
I've got to suffocate while I keep on waiting
For the hour I'll be called to realize
And see it all before my eyes

The sky is crawling down the mound
Into the deadwood on the ground
They say

[Hansi Kürsch:]
Spectres flare and spit and rise
To mingle with the skies
And take all that's never meant to be

[Tobias Sammet:]
A fire in the dark for the fool's gonna find his way
Gonna run and never get away
Is it love that glows in fiery alignment?
Starry-eyed? Maybe living a lie?
[Hansi Kürsch:]
A lonely heart in and endless line

[Tobias Sammet:]
Oh raven child
Raven child

[Jorn Lande:]
Bewildering and strange
The scent of spring and cherry blossoms
Sweet scent of rain
They're calling you
Astounding how it is
Not the same it used to be
When you're compelled behind
The crenel on your own

The tolling of the bell, is there
Anyone to tell me what they wanna say

[Tobias Sammet:]
Voices go on and on and on to me
But their tongues won't permeate
Throughout my soul

[Jorn Lande:]
In your altered state of mind
In vain you're chasing light
Your master in his frown
Denial of the crown of creation
You're mad to think you are

[Tobias Sammet:]
A fire in the dark for the fool's gonna find his way
Gonna run and never get away
Is it love that glows in fiery alignment?

A fire in the dark for the fool's gonna find his way
Gonna run and never get away
Is it love that glows in fiery alignment?
Starry-eyed? Maybe living a lie?
A lonely heart in and endless line

[Jorn Lande:]
Light breeze in the crowns of the willows
Green fields as if the day was on the wane
Grow faint and attain to perfection
What a backdrop for a diamond

[Tobias Sammet:]
And so we sway in the wind like the willow
Meant to give way to the order of the storm
Won't leave a mould in the marsh of the ages
A tired chevalier of fortune

[Hansi Kürsch:]
Blue and serene once a sky swanned on magic
The unborn in the stream of destiny
Time flows to become a mound of nothing
For a broken soldier of fortune

[Tobias Sammet:]
On my...

[Chanting:]
Comin' down
Goin' all the way now
You won't get away
You know
Finally the way you're shown
You're goin' now

[Jorn Lande:]
Into the light

[Tobias Sammet:]
In the light there's a crack torn open
From underneath the day
In the light, but a crack, is it growing?
Feel the dark rolling in, your way
Feel the light look away
It's gonna blind you
Ignite you spirits fly

[Jorn Lande:]
See a light to uncloak their master
To arouse the beaten mind

[Tobias Sammet:]
In the light there's a crack torn open
From underneath the day

[Jorn Lande:]
You dream and fly

[Tobias Sammet:]
In the light, but a crack, is it growing?
Feel the dark rolling in your way

[Jorn Lande:]
Hey raven child

[Tobias Sammet:]
Feel the light look away
It's gonna blind you
Ignite you spirits fly

[Jorn Lande:]
Uncloak the raven master
To arouse the beaten mind

You tuck away yourself inside
You ride away on the inmost light
Your soul glowing opal-blue

[Tobias Sammet:]
A million voices fade away
I never really got what they're trying to say
For my words there's no getting through

[Jorn Lande:]
Oh, you sail to the night's plutonian shore
You drift to sleep
You can't take no more of this
And like a raven child
You spread your paltry wings and throw
Yourself into the wind to escape from all below
That despised the raven child

[Tobias Sammet:]
Am I awake or is it an evil dream
Or maybe the ugly in between
Like me... a weak hermaphrodite

[Jorn Lande:]
A burning soul in unimpaired parts
In quest for light but it was the dark
That embraced the raven child

[Tobias Sammet:]
A cloak of invisibility to curtain
The fate of deformity, no...
Darkness let me in

[Jorn Lande:]
Off to the night's plutonian shores
You dream and hope you won't wake no more to this!
Flying raven child

[Tobias Sammet:]
Oh fiery eyes

[Jorn Lande:]
Flying raven child

[Tobias Sammet:]
Oh fiery eyes

[Jorn Lande:]
Oh to escape from all below
Spread your wings... and go
Like a raven child

5. Starlight
Walking down a lonely road
A ghost city sidewalk scene
And I wonder if there's a place
Where they bury all their unborn dreams - oh

Some castle in the sky
A place that only I can back down to
And look out for that shining guide ablaze
Out somewhere

Waiting for a sign in vain
That’s gonna shine away the pain
Gonna draw the moonlight down
All is gonna tumble down

Are you gonna guide me starlight
Guide me starlight
Won't you send me a sign?

You're adrift until you strand
Desert island of mundanity
You circle round your solitude
Within the walls they call austerity

I know maybe it’s insane
To dream of what you'll never gain
Nothing on the line
Driven by unsettled certainty

Waiting for a sign in vain
That's gonna shine away the pain
Gonna cite a figment down
Yet I'm gonna stick around

Are you gonna guide me starlight
Guide me starlight

Are you out there, anywhere, at all?

Anywhere at all

If only I'd burn out before I'd hit the ground
Just like you before they're near me
Run out in the clouds forever near me
I won't even be a foolish memory

Waiting for a sign in vain
Orphan star, shine on me

Waiting for a sign...

Waiting for a sign in vain
Gonna shine away the pain
Gonna draw the moonlight down
All is gonna tumble down

Are you gonna hear me starlight
Hear me starlight
Are you out there anywhere at all

Waiting for a sign...

Waiting for a sign in vain
Gonna shine away the pain
Gonna draw the moonlight down
All is gonna tumble down

Are you gonna hear me starlight
Hear me starlight
Are you out there

6. Invincible
Hold on tight
You don't let go
Bygone days bound to corrode
Sentimental, poignant
Shady recollections slowly fade away
Beckon to nothing

All had begun just with a dream
Watered down
Sometimes you failed to feel
Pushed around, you’re losing ground
The sands of time they taint the instant
A stifled fire

You fade to nothing
Will you fell like you don't belong
Or will you cease to feel at all

Throw yourself into the waves
Let 'em roll and carry you away into the sea
To wash off all fragility
Throw yourself into the ocean
Jaded, blunt, invisible...

Invincible!

Throw yourself into the waves
Let ’ em roll, carry you away into the sea
To wash away all fragility
Throw yourself into the ocean
Jaded, blunt, invisible...

Placid, numb and jaded

Throw yourself into the waves
Let 'em roll and carry you away into the sea
To wash away all fragility
Throw yourself into the ocean
Jaded, blunt, invisible...

Invincible!

7. Alchemy
The writing's on the wall
Will you go on and fool yourself?
In no time you’ll be done

Refusing to adjust yourself to the flow
Why walk the stoney road?
You won't get out alive

Nobody understands it, do you?
Come in and look around:
Every single stroke, they say
Was worth the pain
Now, in this gallery of wonder
You wonder what it's all about
Well, selling sun in the rain!

We’re gonna give them bite-sized harmony
Oh, we're gonna shove it down their throats

Dreams and fire - we are alchemy
You set out on the losing end
Gonna make you whole again
Waste to diamonds - we are alchemy
No one to be left in need
We're gilding their reality

We gotta keep 'em dancing
While tears pour out of blackened skies
Another shade of drama

Spectators weeping over cries
That broken heroes
Drag from crazy minds
And by the way, now:

They who pay the piper call the tune at last
Knowing what you wanna give
And what is gonna do
Feeding on desire
The spectres shall arise
Right in front of their eyes

We're gonna give them perfect harmony
Oh, we're gonna shove it down their throats

Dreams and fire - we are alchemy
You set out on the losing end
Gonna make you whole again

Waste to diamonds - we are alchemy
No one to be left in need
We're gilding their reality

We'd never lie
We’re never ever gonna let you down

When danger and distraction lie in wait
We’d never lie
When dreams aspire to take you down
We' never dare to lie to you
You’re just spared the part of truth
That doesn't make any sense to you...

Dreams and fire - we are alchemy
You set out on the losing end
Gonna make you whole again
Waste to diamonds - we are alchemy

No one's to be left in need
A new take on reality

8. The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn
For too long now I've been
Adrift in this ocean that washed over me

Diluting the secrets that you had to keep
From the world that's been...

...spinning around you, with and without you
Sedating, unkind

Show you the way
Deliver and faint!
Relish to stand in line!

Oh

I guess you'll find no one to blame
We're tied to the rules of someone else's game

Try to fly, flap your wings
As you look to the night sky
A gilded cage in the twilight

You dance on a wire
See the piper at the gates of dawn
Been caught in the mire
Now you're reaching for the stars oh oh

Oh, dance on the wire
To the breeze that carries change
Tonight you will see the Great Pan in the stars
The piper at the gates of dawn you'll hear

Oh

For quite a while I have been
The one that I thought I was happy to be

Masquerade, at least a shadow play
No one's gonna see...

...behind the fascade, those rallying calls
You're afraid to awake

Look at the sky, you can't defy
The dark that is calling your name

You're blind by the beauty around
You're numb by the touch
And you're deaf to the sound
Of the sweet-smelling
Bright melody of the moonlight
That devours the bars in the twilight

You dance on a wire
See the piper at the gates of dawn
Been caught in the mire
Now you're reaching for the stars oh oh

Dance on the wire
To the breeze that carries change tonight
You will see the Great Pan in the stars
The piper at the gates of dawn you'll hear

Now open your eyes, ain't it what you've been wanting
Too much to fathom, until it unfolds

Endure what you're in for, you're meant to be longing
King of the wave, now keep flailing about

We're the dream the inhabits the waking old world
We're right here, we're the doorway to guide you across

Exposed to the spirits that you're meant to be citing
Misfit and misplaced, you'll never belong

We're the breath you don't catch
We're the great expectations
You ain't measured up to on the beautiful side

We're the promise not kept - bred in desolation
We're the will of the wisp - demerged from the light

Get me out of here
Take me away
Take me
Take me
Take me away
Take me away

Dance on the wire
See the piper at the gates of dawn
Now you're reaching for the stars

You dance on a wire
See the piper at the gates of dawn
Been caught in the mire
Now you're reaching for the stars oh oh
Dance on the wire
To the breeze that carries change - tonight
You will see, the Great Pan in the stars
The Piper at the Gates of dawn is near

9. Lavender
They were taking small pains
To not make him realize
Made him feel he's different
Through and through

A monster in his own way
Communicative quarantine
Unleashed on the world without a clue

Surrounded by the ghosts of paling pictures
They come and slip away

Vivid memories roll and spin
If only they would suck me in

We're going up like fire in
Just the blink between the dream
And the memories and the embers
Of what we'd hoped it all would be

Breathing odour of lavender
And it's all coming back to me
Wish I didn't fail to say those
Words before you'd have to leave

A soul, a storm, a journey across the waves

Here I stand and survey
What the Father's cast my way
A wind got up to bode times of change

I close the door behind me
Know the day break is too far

Me and who I was:
Alone, estranged

Surrounded by the scent invoking pictures
Gone and yet so clear

Vivid memories roll and spin
If only they would suck me in

We're going up like fire in
Just the blink between the dream
And the memories and the embers
Of what we'd hoped it all would be

Breathing odour of lavender
And it's all coming back to me
Wish I didn't have to see now
What back then I didn't see

A soul, a storm, a journey across the waves

The crazy part ain't dreaming, wishing on a falling star
It's the world that's in between the cope and you
I close my eyes and see a magic world in sepia
That cast me out onto a road without a clue

We're going up like fire in
Just the blink between the dream
And the memories and the embers
Of what we'd hoped it all would be

We're going up like fire in
Just the blink between the dream
And the memories and the embers
Of what we'd hoped it all would be

Breathing odour of lavender
And it's all coming back to me
Wish I didn't fail to say those
Words before you'd have to leave

A soul, a storm, a journey across the waves
A soul, a storm, a journey across the waves
A soul, a storm, a journey across the waves

10. Requiem For A Dream
What do you see?
Is it your own reflection that's staring at you?
An out-of-body perception?
Or some kind of stranger that laughs at a fool?

Is it the world that has changed?
Or is it you at the sound of the knell?
And how did they fail to prepare you
For all that awaits once you're out of your shell?

Oh oh
Feel the cold breeze in your face
Walk on, one way
End of days

Time to face what it's all about
May the waves take you in

A long way from home
You're out on your own
To crave all alone and alone you'll realize
What life turns out to be...

Future ain't what it used to be
When all givens they fall into abeyance
Fall into abeyance

Let it all wash over me
Requiem for a dream

How long have we stayed in concealment
Chilled to the marrow, crept stealthily?
Celestial lights satiating the dark
Of deplorable reality

Every breath towards what shone with a lustre
Horizons that sentineled dreams
Now doesn't it even seem crazy
To be aghast at what things will not be

Oh oh
See the rainbow slowly fade
Walk on, one way
End of days...

Time to face what it's all about
May the waves take you in

A long way from home
You're out on your own
To crave all alone and alone you'll realize
What life turns out to be...

Future ain't what it used to be
Fall into abeyance
Fall into abeyance

Let it all wash over me
Requiem for a dream

There's someone by your side
Four steps behind
Makes sure you keep the pace
And love the grind

Time to face what it's all about
May the waves take you in
A long way from home
You're out on your own
To crave all alone and alone you'll realize
Future ain't what it used to be
And all givens they fall into abeyance
Fall into abeyance

Let it all wash over me
Requiem for a dream

11. Maniac
[originally by Michael Sembello]Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Looking for the fight of her life in the real time world
No one sees her at all they all say she's crazy

Locking rhythm to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife if the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at the show,
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice blue line of insanity is a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery, touch it but can't hold it
You work all your life, for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by it's a push shove world
But there's always a chance if the hunger stays the night

There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

It can cut you like a knife if the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

12. Heart
Don't we all keep moving on
As we all try to spell forevermore
I have been searching, where I was told
Didn't find myself around the bend

Oh I tried to run forever in a lonely charade

Back on my way, hot on the trail again
Afraid of moving closer to my heart
I would always do anything
Always tried to believe I can
I was burning down inside to play my part

Are we meant to feel ok as we stray in someone else's dream?
Burning with honour and pride - for glory and fame

Oh I tried to run forever in a lonely charade

Back on my way, hot on the trail again
Afraid of moving closer to my heart
I would always do anything
Always tried to believe I can
I was burning down inside to play my part

Back on my way, hot on the trail again
Afraid of moving closer to my heart
