Every endless night has a dawning day
Every darkest sky has a shining ray
And it shines on you baby can't you see
You're the only one who can shine for me
It's a private emotion that fills you tonight
And a silence falls between us
As the shadows steal the light
And wherever you may find it
Wherever it may lead
Let your private emotion come to me
Come to me
When your soul is tired
And your heart is weak
Do you think of love
As a one way street
Well it runs both ways,
Open up your eyes
Can't you see me here,
How can you deny
It's a private emotion that fills you tonight
Every endless night has a dawning day
Every darkest sky has a shining ray
It takes a lot to laugh as your tears go by
But you can find me here
Till your tears run dry
It's a private emotion that fills you tonight
