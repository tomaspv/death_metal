Run holy beloved horse
on this peaceful day
through these valleys kissed by light
where peace is so rare

So hardy trees let me hear your words
about those memories

and epic battles they won

Beware of unholy fire
my guardian of the trees
their flames can't burn the memory
the wisdom of the kings
The secrets of this forest
the ride of unicorns
are treasures of these valleys
where freedom has its throne
where love must reign eternally
avoiding acts of war

We must have all their valour
to defend these lands
or the sun in these valleys
will not shine again

My princess why must I assist at your death
I can't endure this tragic pain

I cry to see the innocent die
Brothers I'm ready the ride can begin

Now the time has come farewell my dear old friends
Ancelot is calling for my help
From the sun of Elgard to the middle plains
for salvation of enchanted lands
I'm looking forward to avenge all those killed
to be face to face

Fire and steel

you will burn hordes of hell
in the deadly raging flames of revenge

Come out from your abyss her tears seek revenge

Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me

To obtain the second key you have to cross the bloody sea
where the thirst of Tharos never ends

Land of immortals I wait for my day
to reach the wisdom of your skies
Land of immortals you must belong to me

8. Echoes Of Tragedy
Where sun creates shadow's games
where tragic echoes speak of death why Lord why
between the ruins through lakes of holy blood
I walk in tears for my wasted land

Echoes of tragedy carved on my steel
in this neverending fight against the beast
soldiers of twilight turn back to hell
burn in your fire or glory for me will be your end

Mothers and children embraced in blood
torture and rape will leave their sign
after the sorrow I call the holy rage
burn in my heart now flames of blind hate

Echoes of tragedy carved on my steel
in this neverending fight against the beast
soldiers of twilight turn back to hell
burn in your fire or glory for me will be your end

9. Lord Of The Thunder
Born in the time of darkness and evil under the sign of God

and for the conquest of justice and honour I will use my steel

Holy flame burn again for eternity burn my heart to win
the holy war is awaiting another fiery king

Rage in my heart crossing the forest riding my black horse
across the valley along the river where the hot blood flows
Over the lakes and over the hills I follow the call of the wind
uphold the legend and for my princess I will fight and win

10. Legendary Tales
And darkness covers all the land
the silent river flows
the jesters dance around the flame
playing an ancient song

A song of mighty warriors
of epic bloody fights
while moonlight meets the manor's walls
and I must close my eyes

Another tale of infinite wars
for the defenders of holy light
the fire enters my mind
the blood of the innocent before my eyes
spreading the wings of the dream
I want to win between fire and steel
for them all

Some knights sleep near fire
drowned in their own red wine
the elder looks at the high flame
knowing the fight will reprise

The magic twittering of the birds
meets the light of dawn
the ancient song is fading now
but my old dream carries on

Another tale of infinite wars
for the defenders of holy light
the fire enters my mind
the blood of the innocent before my eyes
spreading the wings of the dream
I want to win between fire and steel
for them all

*******************************

1. Emerald Sword
[Turilli]

I crossed the valleys the dust of midlands
to search for the third key to open the gates
Now I?m near the altar the secret inside
as legend told my beloved sun light the dragon?s eyes
On the way to the glory I?ll honor my sword
to serve right and justice for all

Finally happened the sun lit their eyes
the spell was creating strange games of light
Thanks to hidden mirrors I found my lost way
over the stones I reached the place it was a secret cave
In a long bloody battle that prophecies told
the light will prevail hence wisdom is gold

For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search for the emerald sword

Only a warrior with a clear heart
could have the honor to be kissed by the sun
Yes, I?m that warrior I followed my way
led by the force of cosmic soul I can reach the sword
On the way to the glory I?ll honor my sword
to serve right ideals and justice for all

For the king for the land for the mountains
for the green valleys where dragons fly
for the glory the power to win the black lord
I will search

2. Where Dragons Flymm
[Turilli]

The way is long, time is too short
this little footpath seems never to end
Green are the trees, musk on the stones
how it looks strange this mystical world
Sweet smelling rose what do you hide
behind your innocence red like my blood

Hungry for victory, hungry for love
love for the earth that made her son
strong and invincible serving my cry
go now and ride there where dragons fly 
The rocks appear in front of me
when the first shadows pretude to dark
Near is your end wild holy path
open my eyes to what the sun hides
Beloved mountain what do you hide
Where does your river flow, I want to know

Hungry for victory, hungry for love
love for the earth that made her son
strong and invincible serving my cry
go now and ride there where dragons fly

3. Land Of Immortals
[Turilli/Staropoli]

Hear the silence of the winds making 
your own destiny go and face the 
mirror of their sin Only brave hearts 
found the way breaking all the 
dragon's spell cross the Argon's
glade with heart in hand
Land of immortals I wait for my day 
to reach the wisdom of your skies 
Land of immortals you must belong 
to me from here to eternity

And between Elgard's hills near the 
ancient ruins of Kron you will face 
the trick of the old dwarf To obtain 
the second key you have to cross them 
bloody sea where the thirst of Tharos 
never ends

Land of immortals I wait for my day 
to reach the wisdom of your skies 
Land of immortals you must belong
to me from here to eternity
Holy force of wisdom spread through
all the air I shall breathe you forever
to end this epic holy quest My way 
will be hard but I would do all to reach 
the valleys where true heroes ride 
beyond the ivory gates

Land of immortals I wait for my day to 
reach the wisdom of your skies Land 
of immortals you must belong to me 
from here to eternity
