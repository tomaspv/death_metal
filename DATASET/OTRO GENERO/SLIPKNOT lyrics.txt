1. (sic)
Enemy - Show me what you wanna be 
I can handle anything 
Even if I can't handle you 
Readily - Either way it better be 
Don't you fuckin' pity me 
Get up, get off... 
What the hell am I sayin'? 
I don't know about malevolent 
Sure as hell decadent 
I want somebody to step up, step off 
Walls! Let me fall! Fuck you all! 
Get a grip, don't let me slip 'til I drop the ball 

I - I want it all! 
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it 
You're goin' down, this is a war! 

Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind? 
You're leavin' me suspect, I'm leavin' you grotesque 
Feels like a burn from which you never learn 
Cause and effect, you jealous ass 
Press your face against the glass - suffer 

I want it all! 
Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it 
You're goin' down, this is a war! 
I've just begun 
It's about that time 
Gotta get mine 

You can't kill me 
Cuz I'm already inside you 

Sick

2. Eyeless
Insane - Am I the only muthafucker with a brain? 
I'm hearing voices but all they do is complain 
How many times have you wanted to kill 
Everything and everyone - Say you'll do it but never will 

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 

I am my Father's son 
He's a phantom, a mystery and that leaves me 
Nothing! 
How many times have you wanted to die? 
It's too late for me. All you have to do is get rid of me! 

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 

It's all in your head 
It's all in my head 
It's all in your head 

I tried - You lied to me for so long 
Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it 
Freak on my antics and give me a choice 
Doesn't matter if I give a shit 
It's shit that you gave me 

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes 

It's all in your head 
It's all in my head 
It's all in your head 

Do you wanna feel pain? Takin' my name in vain 
Caring never felt so lame inside 
Anybody else got pride? Do you wanna take my life? 
Maybe I'll reverse my ride 
Who the hell are you? Fuck you! 
Better suck it up cuz you bled through 
Better get away from me 
Stay the fuck away from me! 

I feel safe - Seems your saved 

Look me in my brand new eye

3. Wait And Bleed
I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander over where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

Goodbye! 

I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time 
Everything is 3D blasphemy 
My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up 
This is not the way I pictured me 
I can't control my shakes 
How the hell did I get here? 
Something about this, so very wrong... 
I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this 
Is it a dream or a memory? 

I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander over where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

Get outta my head cuz I don't need this 
Why I didn't I see this? 
I'm a victim - Manchurian candidate 
I have sinned by just 
Makin' my mind up and takin' your breath away 

I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander over where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

Goodbye! 

You haven't learned a thing 
I haven't changed a thing 
My flesh was in my bones 
The pain was always free 

I've felt the hate rise up in me... 
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves... 
I wander out where you can't see... 
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed... 

And it waits for you!

4. Surfacing
Running out of ways to run 
I can't see, I can't be 
Over and over and under my skin 
All this attention is doing me in! 

Fuck it all! Fuck this world! 
Fuck everything that you stand for! 
Don't belong! Don't exist! 
Don't give a shit! 
Don't ever judge me! 

Picking through the parts exposed 
Taking shape, taking shag 
Over and over and under my skin 
All this momentum is doing me in! 

Fuck it all! Fuck this world! 
Fuck everything that you stand for! 
Don't belong! Don't exist! 
Don't give a shit! 
Don't ever judge me! 

You got all my love, livin' in your own hate 
Drippin' hole man, hard step, no fate 
Show you nuthin', but I ain't holdin' back 
Every damn word I say is a sneak attack 
When I get my hands on you 
Ain't a fuck thing you can do 
Get this cuz you're never gonna get me 
I am the very disease you pretend to be 

I am the push that makes you move

5. Spit It Out
Since you never gave a damn in the first place 
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned 
Cuz in the interest of all involved I got the problem solved 
And the verdict is guilty... 

...Man nearly killed me 
Steppin' where you fear to tread 
Stop, drop and roll - you were dead from the git-go!! 
Big mouth fucker, stupid cocksucker! 
Are you scared of me now? Then you're dumber than I thought 
Always is, never was 
Foundation made of piss and vinegar 
Step to me, I'll smear ya - Think I fear ya? bullshit! 
Just another dumb punk chompin' at this tit 
Is there any way to break through the noise? 
Was it something that I said that got you bent? 
It's gotta be that way if you want it 
Sanity, Literal Profanity hit me! 

Spit it out 
All you wanna do is drag me down 
All I wanna do is stamp you out 

Maybe it's the way you spread a lotta rumour fodder 
Keepin' all your little spies and leavin' when you realise 
Step up, fairy 
I guess it's time to bury your ass with the chrome 
Straight to the dome 
You heard that right, bitch, I didn't stutter 
If you know what's good - sit, shut up and beg, brother 
Backstab - Don't you know who you're dissin'? 
Side swipe - we know the ass that you're kissin'! 
Bigidy - bigidy bitch boy, halfwat hauser 
Can't hear shit cuz I keep gettin' louder 
Step up, and you get a face full o' tactic 
Lippin' off hard, goin' home in a basket 
You got no pull, no power, no nuthin' 
Now you start shit? Well, ain't that somethin'? 
Payoffs don't protect, and you can't hide if you want 
But I'll find you - Comin' up behind you! 

Spit it out 
All you wanna do is drag me down 
All I wanna do is stamp you out 

'Bout time I set this record straight 
All the needlenose punchin' is makin' me irate 
Sick o' my bitchin' fallin' on deaf ears 
Where YOU gonna be in the next five years? 
The crew and all the fools, and all the politix 
Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick 
You got dick when they passed out the good stuff 
Bam 
Are you sick of me? Good enough - had enough 

Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies! 
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemas! 

Spit it out 
All you wanna do is drag me down 
All I wanna do is stamp you out

6. Tattered And Torn
[differs from 1996 version]

Kill Me

(Tattered and torn)
Something aches
(Tattered and torn)
Bad things slither
(Tattered and torn)
My floors are burning down
(Tattered and torn)
And I can't find a window

(Tattered and torn)
This is medieval
(Tattered and torn)
This is cerebral
(Tattered and torn)
Suffocated
(Tattered and torn)
Melodramatic

(Tattered and torn)
Driven to the verge of
(Tattered and torn)
I make you my enemy
(Tattered and torn)
The nerves you sever
(Tattered and torn)
Can serve you better

(Tattered and torn)
In the blink of an eye
(Tattered and torn)
In the space of a second
(Tattered and torn)
Open my wrists
(Tattered and torn)
Give me my lessons

(Tearing myself apart)
From the things that make me hurt

7. Frail Limb Nursery
She lay as though she were in a trance, 
With her long eyelashes fluttering like she was dreaming. 
She said to him "I lie beyond the sea", 
And then all of a sudden her head dipped back and she vanished. 

Gone, gone without a trace. 
Gone. 

She's never coming back, do you know what it's like to live with that? 
No one knows what it's like. 
The only one who knew me, gone."

8. Purity
Maze...psychopathic daze...I create this waste 
Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic 
ways...can't escape this place...I deny your face 
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying 

Put me in a homemade cellar 
Put me in a hole for shelter 
Someone hear me please, all I see is hate 
I can hardly breathe, and I can hardly take it 

HANDSONMYFACEOVERBEARINGICAN'TGETOUT 

Lost...ran at my own cost...hearing laughter, scoffed 
Learning from the rush, detached from such and such 
Bleak...all around me, weak...listening, incomplete 
I am not a dog, but I'm the one your dogging 

I am in a buried kennel 
I have never felt so final 
Someone find me please, losing all reserve 
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying 

You all stare, but you'll never see 
There is something inside me 
There is something in you I despise 

Cut me - show me - enter - I am 
willing and able and never any danger to myself 
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain 
Or was my tolerance a phase? 
Empathy, out of my way 
I can't die 

Purity

9. Liberate
Liberate - My madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate - My madness
I just want to...

Section off myself
Put a wall up/What the hell have I done
Keep the dog at bay
Survive by saving me!
Values and the game
Not a fuck-up - Not a part of your lie
I am one, I am all - I'm above and beyond!

Stand off of the shit
Back off or I'll spit
So soft, you forget
Your garbage in is garbage out
You don't give a shit
I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this
Your garbage in is garbage out

Liberate my madness...

Liberate - My madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate - My madness
I just want to...

I am not ashamed
What is vital, isn't always humane
You can break in vain
But you can't break away
Even in my face
Lotta bullshit, not alotta the truth
I can't see from here
But I can smell your fear

Back off of the shit
Stand off or I'll spit
So soft, you forget
Your garbage in is garbage out
You don't give a shit
I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this
Your garbage in is garbage out

Saved - You're such a slave - I don't expect a
Name - You don't care - I wasn't witness -
I can't be a part of a system such as this
Hard eyes - Glow right - In my - Darkness - Again
With the sickness, renegade blisters, sisters,
Salivate, litigate, liberate, madness, sadness
Fuck this - How long have I had this?
I don't need this - Outta my business
Insert, engage, betrayed, my God
Fraud

Liberate - My madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate - My madness
I just want to...

10. Prosthetics
Even if you run... I will find you 
I decided I wanted you 
Now I know...I need 
If you can't be bought, tougher than I thought 
Keep in mind - I am with you 
Never left out fate, can't concentrate 

You will be mine! 
Ah, fucking you will be mine! 
Ah, fucking you will be mine! 
Ah, fucking you will be mine! 

I found you 

Leanin' out of an open window 
You laughed (my fingers clenched) 
Too perfect, far too careless 
I couldn't help myself - I just took you 

Dammit man I knew it was a mistake 
(You brought it outta me) 

Better make yourself out home 
You're here to stay 
You won't bother me...If you let me bother you 
All the doors are locked, all the windows shut 
Keep in mind - I watch you 
Never leave my side, never leave me, fucker 
Even if you run 

What the fuck is different? Man, I can't believe I'm doin' this 

Dammit man I knew it was a mistake 
(You brought it outta me)

11. No Life
My freedom is best 
Whole country's on house arrest 
And everyone's a suspect 
You can't feel the flow because you died 
Face down on a "suicide" 
The muthafucker's on self-destruct 
Nobody guardin' your back, it's all a front 
Save this! My rage is bliss! 
I'm takin' names and gettin' pissed! 

Where's Chuck D when ya need him? 
You ain't shit, just a puddle on the 
Bed spread 
The maniac psycho 
Cool j screamed the shit 
But I still can't believe it 
Man, it's funny that you scare me so 
Just enough to fuck me up again and again 
Hard life is hard as hell 
Better back the fuck on up 
Cuz this is... 

No kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(I've got to get out!) 
It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(You can't blame me!) 

Can't be real no more - Your mask is skin and bone 
Savor every flavor you want cuz it's not your own 
Bad-ass at bat, man 
Forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win 
Breathe! Amer-cult, Breathe! On more - Seethe! 
Freak like you gotta pair 
Won't be my fault 
When you're painted in the corner of a no-good life 
This is... 

No kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(I've got to get out!) 
It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(You can't blame me!) 

I can't remember, I don't understand, 
Is it malice that makes you this way? 
Carry it with you 'til someone forgives you 
I laugh cuz there's nothing to say 
You can't begin to consider the 
Palpable hate in the air when you're here 
None of us wonder what weather you're under 
You're making it perfectly clear! 

Lights ain't on - shit ain't right 
Never had peace so I had to fight 
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against 
The wall, slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me 
You're all reality and sound bites 
And the freedom is never in plain sight 
The feelings, the question, the price is too 
Human, for fucking sake - This is... 

No kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(I've got to get out!) 
It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life! 
(You can't blame me!)

12. Diluted
I'm cold, I'm ugly 
I'm always confused by everything 
I can stare into a thousand eyes 
But every smile hides a bold-faced lie 

It itches, it seethes, it festers and breathes 
My heros are dead, they died in my head 
Thin out the herd, squeeze out the pain 
Something inside me has opened up again 

Thoughts of me exemplified 
All the little flaws I have denied 
Forget today, forget whatever happened 
Everyday I see a little more of overall deficiencies 
I'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe 

What the hell - did I - do to deserve - all of this? 

I save all the bullets from ignorant minds 
Your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind 
Way past good taste, on our way to bad omens 
I decrease, while my symptoms increase 

God what the fuck is wrong 
You act like you knew it all along 
Your timing sucks, your silence is a blessing 

All I ever wanted out of you was 
Something you could never be 
Now take a real good look at 
What you've fucking done to me 

What the hell - did I - do to deserve - all of this? 

Gimme any reason why I'd need you, boy 
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you, bitch 
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up 

I see you in me 

I keep my scars from prying eyes 
Incapable of ever knowing why 
Somebody breathe, I've got to have an answer 

Why am I so fascinated by 
Bigger pictures, better things 
But I don't care what you think 
You'll never understand me 

What the hell - did I - do to deserve - all of this? 

Fuck!

13. Only One
[Lyrics differ from the same-titled song off of the album "Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat" (1996)]

Pain - made to order

I'm not the second coming, I'm the first wave
Better get an army, cuz the fire left me unscathed
You betcha bottom dollar I'm the top of the shit pile
So stick around cuz I'll get to you in just a few
Step off the achtung, get back or get stung
Idiotic sense of yourself, are you that dumb?
Entire legion of me, totalitarian
The one and only muthafucka, top of the world man

Cuz I can't stand it, planned it, gonna crash land it
In other words, consider me branded
Another version of me, another version of you
Both barrels - what you gonna do?

All I hear is human noise
You made your own fuckin' choice
I belong to only me
Silence for my revelry

I can over die over time
Filthy hands, stay away from mine
Every reason is a right to hate
Painful clutch - death is fine, gimme mine

Only one of us walks away

Somebody explain this
You don't care cuz you don't exist
What the fuck is this another joke?
Reckoning!

14. Scissors
I play doctor for five minutes flat 
Before I cut my heart open...and let the air out 
Three bugs, a pound of dust 
Some wind spilled over me 
In the strangest manner that had 
Broke away my tear spout 

As I lie there 
With my tongue spread wide open 
A black widow had offered me 
A sweatheart tube 
As I injected 
The candid heart that I selected 
She said don't hesitate 
Just do what you have to do! 

It's hard to stay between the lines of skin 
Just cuz I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel 
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway 
Just let the blood run red CUZ I CAN'T FEEL! 

Biding my time until the time is right 
Biding my time until the time is right 
Biding my time until the time is right 
Biding my time... 
It's time 

It is time

15. Eeyore
Meet the man that made me 
Greet the can that I came from 
Oh the fucking sacred heart of Jesus 
Blew it in the back room 
Feelin' like a real goon 
Slam the fuck aside, man 
I'm on - you're not 

I am the great big mouth 

Good riddance - though I'm sad to say 
I didn't get to kill you 
Rhetoric - Better look both ways 
I gotta get an arm through 
Stain 
What the fuck is up? Get the fuck away 
Run if you want to 
Innocent? You're a guilty conscience 
Laugh last - break through 
Stain 

Prepare you fucker 

I don't give a shit, bitch 
I don't give a fuck, bitch 
I don't understand, bitch 
You don't matter 
I don't give a fuck, man
I don't give a shit, man
I don't really care, man 
I'm the super sized man

1. Insert Coin
I'm counting all the killers...

2. Unsainted
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?

3. Birth Of The Cruel
(Let him crave understanding
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him... promote
Father... my self-control)

I'm just a Judas, looking for a silver line
And tomorrow is still a step behind
Hey hey drama, I'd love to be a waste of your time
Oh no, thanks so much for wasting mine
So hear me out

Let's hear it for the damaged
Who understands but the broken?
Developed in the arms of spite
I'm all fucked up and I make it look good
Adrenalin sight tonight

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

Sick, sickened, I'm sickening, I'm stricken by the fist
Blessed are the fires that have burned me
Listen to this, the lesson is, never underestimate the agony
Death of the fool, birth of the cruel

Remember how you spent the best part of forever in a state of pure disease
It was another thing altogether to forget that you brought out the worst in me
Hey Karma, you don't feel like I do
You just wish you'd hate like I do

We are the Bitter, the maladjusted and wise
Fighting off a generation too uptight
We're all dressed up with nobody to kill
The rhetoric stops tonight

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

Sick, sickened, I'm sickening, I'm stricken by the fist
Blessed are the fires that have burned me
Listen to this, the lesson is, never underestimate the agony
Death of the fool, birth of the...
Birth of the cruel!
Yeah!

Now's not the time for denying
Shifting the focus to scare
Let's not forget we're all guilty
All three dimensions polluted by earnest despair

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

(Let him crave understanding
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him... promote
Father... my self-control
That he can see and look at the enemy in front of him
And just goes, "Not today, sucker
Go back to Hell where you belong!")

4. Death Because Of Death
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of you

5. Nero Forte
Watch this!

I'm never enough
You bleed me dry, using me up
Dissatisfied, and used
Another key to the empty spot in you
I'm sick as a fuck
I'm in my prime, what do you want?
I guess it's time, to see
If you're lost in hell you'll find no peace

Ooh, wade through hate and fear
I haven't felt like this in years
Not much left, so uprooted
Fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie
And I know where I need to go
But the voice of reason can't say no
It's in the eyes, and heart
Just the latest psycho off the charts

That's what you do best!

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

I know, and even if I didn't
I would lie so, many would believe it
Stand up and resist the chains
Of all the people in belligerent sick restraint
I wasn't enough
You bled me dry, which way is up?
Oh, you're a lie, and fake
I hope the truth is not too late

That's what you do best!

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

That's what you do best!

That's what you do best...
That's what you do best... Hahahahahaha...

(WHY) Why was it easy for you?
(DID) Did I deserve the abuse?
(I) I can't believe I let it
(NOT) Not what I wanted
(SEE) See through your bullshit
(YOUR) You're so traumatic
(TRUE) True to your form of
(FACE) Every consequence
(UN) Unintimidated
(TIL) Till the very end
(IT) It'll never happen
(WAS) Was it all a lie?
(TOO) Many motherfuckers
(LATE) That's what you do best!
(LIE) That's what you do best!
(LIE) That's what you do best!

Oh, that's what you do best!

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy

At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

That's what you do,
That's what you do best!
(What you, do best
What you, do best) Yeah!
(What you, do best
What you, do best
What you, do best
What you, do best)
That's what you do best!
That's what you do best!

6. Critical Darling
Yeah!

God's in a coma
Put Faith in a life support
Running away won't feel the same
If you reach a metaphysical last resort
Oh, malevolence and purgatory give you pause
It's a miracle you haven't broken any laws
We are not entitled to surviving
So keep your friends and your enemies thriving

(Good for you!) What a cliché...
(Just not true!) What a giveaway!
(What comes now!) Can't be the last one
Falling down!

Every time this happens I'm breaking a promise I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet and keep it away from the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

Once again, we got suffocated
In a sick perversion of a spider's web
Crawling over all the spent, digested pieces
Celebrate the dead
Here come all the judging eyes
Gotta pave the road with your best intentions
I only wish you could picture a future
That doesn't resemble your crazy inventions

(Good on you!) I don't mean it...
(Dream come true!) I don't need it!
(What goes up!) Another Hollow One
Must come down!

Every time this happens I'm breaking a promise I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet and keep it away from the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

A mirror only works if you open your eyes
But even then you have to understand what's inside
The easy part is always hardest to see
I know you'll never guess, but darling
You're so critical
Darling, you're so critical
Oh, you're so critical

Oh, this is a cave-in
The weight of the catalyst
Just wait, let the games begin
Gonna tell you all about it for the savages

(Good for you!) Not another one...
(Just not true!) Not another one!
(What comes now!) This world is
Falling down!

Every time this happens I'm breaking a promise I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet and keep it away from the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

It's begun!

Oh, you're so critical!
Yeah!
Oh, you're so critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!

7. A Liar's Funeral
The season at an end
A harvest of seclusion and regret
The burning can begin
A period of ash is what you get
The quiet is a curse
But my respect was shown to you by force
Another day too late
Another neck too eager for the rope

Liar
Liar

Yesterday was hard
Tomorrow is just a promise of the same
When friends have all subscribed
To spitting on the ground to say my name
Fire on the ice
December in the summer kills the heart
Your hate is no surprise
I guess I have to die to play my part

Liar
Liar

Ooh, close your eyes and join the blind
Slit your wrists for peace of mind
Turn your back and show us the truth
There's only one way to remember it for you

Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar

Hold the weight
Never trust the one beside you
Carried away
You know just as much as I do
Hold the weight
Do it all for what you really love
Carried away
Use you up until you've had enough

Hold the weight
Never trust the one beside you
Carried away
You know just as much as I do
Hold the weight
Do it all for what you really love
Carried away
Use you up until you've had enough

Clench your teeth and tighten your grip
Stand up straight, don't let it slip
Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar

True victims and survivors learn to make war
Don't wanna be the Sad Man Singing anymore
I did it all wrong so I'd get it all right
We're wasting all the candles, the dead need no light

Liar
Liar
Liar

8. Red Flag
Yeah!

Past just saving, this is like escaping
Running wild in the middle of weeds
Eyes can't see me, careful with your breathing
Get away or they get to feed
Strength's not enough, be defiant
You're looking for a reason to suffer, you'll find it
But if you want to live to be better, begin it
Your energy won't keep you from getting exhausted and purge it

You don't own me!
You can't hold me!
This is beginning!
You are an ending!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

(Vultures, vultures, vultures, vultures
Vultures, vultures, vultures, vultures)

Vultures salivate poison to exterminate
It's the dawn of the Renaissance
Emancipation, cattle on displacement, you want
To reason but there is no response
I won't allow this to happen
Another situation I feel like I'm trapped in
Nothing is my business and business is gone
I wish you all could fuck off and go back to hell where you belong!

You don't own me!
You can't hold me!
This is beginning!
You are an ending!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Plague! (Plague!) Don't panic (Plague!)
Don't believe the riddle that confuses you
Bitch! (Bitch!) So manic (So manic!)
I can see the light that exposes you
So dramatic, now it's all emphatic means
The bigger the mouth that I can eat you with
Force of habit, God you reek of your havoc
But consider the sources you've been tampering with!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Now you're nothing!
Now you're nothing!
Now you're nothing new!
New!
Oh!
Yeah!

9. What's Next
[Instrumental]
10. Spiders
Well you can go it alone
Or keep it in between
The pages of the books you burn
So no one gets to read
The fingers pull your stitches tight
But knowing someone's secret is not enough
Everyone's a little bit a lot of the time

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

When now is not the time
Tomorrow disagrees
But your real world isn't ready to face
The face behind the real me
Time to think it over
I'm over trying to overthink, I've had enough, huh
Everybody's limited to what's on their mind

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

(Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
(Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)

Make yourself a martyr's pet
And watch them all escape (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
Make yourself at home instead (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
You'll lose your toxic waste (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)

Go it alone
Suffer for your feelings, I'm not enough (no, no, no)
But everyone's a little bitter all of the time

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

11. Orphan
I wept! When I realized
There were no more demons left to conquer
An opportunity to show my feelings
With skin so thick you'd swear it was armor
A penitentiary that only lets the oxygen out
I wasn't ready for a version of the truth to get out
I'm getting desperate, I wouldn't want to fester
In another bad dream, I am a man of extremes

I found the flesh and I'm liking it
I'll put an end to all your fucking psychobabble
We eat the meat 'cause the meat had a soul
We take their lives 'cause to hurt makes us whole

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills your world

Keeping up appearances with acts of attrition
It doesn't matter 'cause I know you'll never listen
Before, you knew it when you saw it
Now you say you never knew it, it was all a big conspiracy
We come together when the hands of pain let go
Is there anybody left to fill this hole?
This shit will never wash off
Give yourself a medal, I swear I fucking give up

We're nothing special, just an accidental tweak of the freak
An evolution of the kennel in the fetish you seek
There's still the part of me that's dying in a dumpster
The one who rose is a motherfucking monster

I've seen the future, and it's simply burning!
I wasn't put here to be so discerning!
You want the world to be dissatisfied?!
You don't care, so why the fuck should I?
Fuck, should I sell myself to stay alive?

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills...
The one who kills your world!

Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything

Tell me all about it
I'd love to hear it
The way I ruin everything I touch
I never thought I'd get to say I'm sorry
But then again I think you ask too much

Too white 2B black
Too black 2B blue
Too sick 2B me
Too fucked 2B you
I only wonder if I'll live to see the end of the road
It always gets me nowhere

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills your world

Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
I am the orphan, the one who kills...
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
I am the orphan, the one who kills...

Yeah-hahahaha...

12. My Pain
Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free to feel all of my pain

I'm your friend
And I'm your shade
Do what you want
Just remember it's for love

I'm your wall
And I'm your rock
Don't run away
Don't forget it's only love

I'm your chain
And I'm your lock
There's no escape
Just as long as I say... love

I'm your death
And I'm your cold
You end with me
Remember: this was never love
(Love, love, love, love)

I'll take this
(Love, love, love, love)
And I'll take that
(Love, love, love, love)
I'll take you too
(Love, love, love)
You can never give too much

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free
Pain

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free to feel all of my pain

I've always felt love this way for you

13. Not Long For This World
Cutting or scratching, they scar the same
The angle is off, the edges are soft, the mark remains
I know I'm bitter and full of rage
You would be too, what I've been through
Knowledge is a difficult age

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!

Carving or biting, we bleed for keeps
Out of control, into the cold, hell repeats
God, I'm starving, spreading me thin
Buying a story, my soul is for sale
Trust is such an arrogant thing

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!

I KNOW THE SHIT YOU EAT
There's nothing mellow in the
DRAMA YOU LIVE AND BREATHE
You like your secrets to be
KEPT IN THE FAMILY
You don't get credit for your
RARE GOOD BEHAVIOR, GO BE A SAVIOR
You don't seem to get what I'm saying...
And I'm sick and tired of explaining!
GOODNIGHT, GOODBYE, GOOD LUCK
There's nothing worse than a
GHOUL MANIFESTO, I'M NOT IMPRESSED THOUGH

The greatest conclusion that I ever had
Was when I woke up and said, "That's enough!"
Living never felt so bad
You don't accept it, and I don't care
Bury yourself above all your guilt
When you're ready it'll be there

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!

I was not long for this world...
I was not long for this world...

I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!

14. Solway Firth
Today, up on this hill, I'm counting all the killers
They sway as they swarm, a look of gluttons in their eyes
They mutter as the body loses warmth
They pick your bones like locks inside a tomb
And take great care to not take care of you
Here's an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

While I was learning to live, we all were living a lie
I guess you got what you wanted
So I will settle for a slaughterhouse soaked in blood and betrayal
It's always somebody else, somebody else was me
You want the real smile?
Or the one I used to practice not to feel like a failure?

I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just want to feel like any other man
I won't show you the whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away

Here's an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

I'm not ahead of my time, I just drew the first breath
If I'm alive tomorrow
I will alleviate the pressure by cutting you out of me
I found my bottom line dead on the front lines
I know I'll never go home
So set fire to your ships and past regrets and be free

I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just want to feel like any other man
I won't show you my whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away

Here's an unexplainable one
What have you done?
What have you done?
Yeah

Oh, while I was learning to live, you taught me how to die
I guess I got what I wanted
Another needle in the back through purified scarification
It wasn't somebody else, you fucking did it to me
You want a real smile?
I haven't smiled in years

15. All Out Life
[Japanese Bonus Track]What a world, the horizon's
Coming like a hell-bent killing machine
Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
Burn it all again at a million degrees
Calling all the adamant upper-level
Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
The enemy is here, I said stop

Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One by one against, give me the name
All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
You hold all the keys, so the chains shouldn't hold you
I know you heard me, I fucking told you

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life

Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal
Children are afraid of the gods
Raise your hands and show me what's impossible
That makes us even, never tell me the odds
What a bore, I'm getting stuck in a metaphor
I don't wanna go to sleep
I need a breakdown quick in negotiations
Get it all together and remember to seethe, stop

Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
Drive by violence, more of the same
I can see where you're going, and I'm really ashamed
Do you think when you act or just act like you're thinking?
I gotta know now, you better tell me

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
I challenge you to all out life

We are gathered here today to get it right
Repeat after me:
"I will not celebrate mediocrity
I will not worship empty shells
I will not listen to worthless noises
I will not subject myself to selected predictable choices
My time, my attention
My quality should not be bought and sold
For convenience's sake, ever"

We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
Pay attention, it's gonna be a while 'til I really feel alright
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life

All out life, yeah
I challenge you to all out fucking life, yeah
Live, live, live, life

Carve
I salt my wounds,
Then lick 'em clean
A cloud of dust,
Then I'm gone
Always dealing with that and this

How we feel,
Facsination,
I need a gun,
I need a gun to carve

Your pain I see,

Carve! There's something inside!
Carve! There's nothing inside!
Carve! There's something inside!
Carve! It's not done till over
Carve! There's something inside!
Carve! There's nothing inside!
Carve! There's something inside!
Carve!

You're gonna get your face slapped,

Gonna make you wanna to take it,
Thank you anyways,

Roll your ass,
Force you to pass,
Least I am not fucked,

You want it even louder,

CCCAARRRVVVEEE

Coleslaw
All the pins are out
Nothing is leaking any more
No less than a thousand times
My brain's been scattered about
Forced to deal with suffering
I make it more than a hobby
Leave my past behind me
Life... LIFE
Show me, show me, SHOW ME

Now the pins are back in
I'm through with resort
Just one more time
To keep my face in

LIFE

Smile, while the blade slides down your face
Pain, for at least 2 or 3 days
You, will come to love all your scars
Feel, all the blessed release

SMILE, WHILE THE BLADE SLIDES DOWN YOUR FACE

Despise
Despise!!! 

Maze...psychopathic daze...I create this waste 
Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic 
ways...can't escape this place...I deny your face 
Sweat gets in my eyes, lash out at all I despise 

HANDSONMYFACEOVERBEARINGICAN'TGETOUT 

Lost...ran at my own cost...hearing laughter, scoffed 
Searching from the rush, detached from such and such 
Bleak...standing on my feet...listening incomplete 
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you dog 

HANDSONMYFACEOVERBEARINGICAN'TGETOUT 

Never - ever - surrender - I WON'T ALLOW IT! [x3]
Never - ever - surrender - DESPISE 
My state of mind gets so one-sided [x4]
Despise! [x4]

Cut me - show me - enter - I am 
Willing and able and never any danger to myself 
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain 
Or was my tolerance a phase? 
Empathy, out of my way 
I can't die 

Never - ever - surrender - I WON'T ALLOW IT! [x3]
Never - ever - surrender - DESPISE 
My state of mind gets so one-sided [x4]

Despise! 

Truth hurts when it's in your face 
Are you afraid of it?

Get This
I don't like a fuckin' thing! Music sucks dick 
Suck the snot end of the tip of my prick 
You fucking cunts, get off of my back 
I don't wanna do a show with your shitty 
fuckin' band - You suck, they suck, guess what, get fucked 
I can't think of any other words to say but fuck 
Don't drag our opinions, our opinions are great 
It's new school face muthafuckers I hate

U.S. bands (suck these nuts) 
Worldwide bands (suck these nuts)

Interloper
Many have come and gone, 
Still left out of the guttural swansong 
Takin' nothin' but the best in the area, 
Givin' me grief, but fucker I'll stare you - 
down, 2-3 you're out of there, 
Maybe it's me but I'm frantic, in a panic 
Ain't never had a problem since you stopped comin' here 
Big man walkin' but bitch, I'm still talkin' 

Can't you see it's gotta be this way? 

Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy) 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy) 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy) 
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up 

Ain't gonna leave and you know I'm never gone fade, 
Here it comes again, gotta burn again 
Time now, throw down, don't dirty me, 
Right on your ugly-ass face cuz 

I aint the one who let you in, 
And I ain't the one who set you off 
But I know damn well when someone's pushing my buttons, 
Let tell you somethin', I'LL PUSH YOU BACK! 

"Soon as that camera goes off, he's gonna fuck that little dog." 

Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy) 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy) 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy) 
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up 

Gimme any reason why I'd need you (bitch) 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (bitch) 
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (bitch) 
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up 

You're made of flesh.... 
(What I'm focused on)

Me Inside
Giving in to what has got me 
Feeling claustrophobic, scarred 
Severed me from all emotion 
Life is just too fucking hard 
Snap! Your face was all it took 
Cuz this need ain't doin' me no good 
Fall on my face, but can't you see? 
This fucking life is killing me! 

Tearing me / Inside 

Too far gone, I'm catatonic 
Leaving you to criticize 
Empty shell and running naked 
All alone... lobotomized 
Back and forth between my hang-ups 
It isn't easy to be hated 
Where do ya go? Whaddya do? 
Simpleton, impromptu, crazy eight 
I never cared, not once 
Gotta get away! 

Tearing me / Inside 

I wasn't promised a thing 
You keep mocking me 
But you will never again 
Before you know - after you're gone 

Gone 

Somos feos apestamos y pero reinamos hoto muthafucka

Nature
He can feel them turn
Spools of milky thread
Folding into though
Seconds tick apart

You molded it, you made it, you caused it, reaction
You licked it, you stole from it, you lied to it, now watch it die
You beat it, you ate from it, you spit on it, retraction
You ignored it, didn’t explain to it, you starved it, now watch it die

(Reversal!) CAN’T TAKE ANYMORE
(Reversal!) CAN’T TAKE ANY…

Resolved to find a way,
To curb his skin addiction
To calcify his mind,
To find the ones who made him
MADE HIM THIS WAY

Greasy winged, uh cus-diaper beaking caw fuss,
I hear your dung falling, I hear your dung falling down
Affing, I mean laughing,
I mean affing at me, eyeing my dowNature
Fat jaws, winter winter present present sniff
Sniff for the fifth time, is no time
Do I come, do I go, do they really seem to know
Gotsta get me some of that creamy filling

(Reversal!) CAN’T TAKE ANYMORE
(Reversal!) CAN’T TAKE ANY-

My assembly line of faces are waiting in a row
Stiff, cold, blue complexions that I used to know
Burn abide my yearbook, for there I found no friends
But the ones I knew were shrink-wrapped in the end

(Reversal!) CAN’T TAKE ANYMORE
(Reversal!) CAN’T TAKE ANY…

CAN’T TAKE ANY…

Their feathers are my hair

CAN’T TAKE ANYMORE
CAN’T TAKE ANY-

Snap
One more time and I'm gonna snap [x 15] 
One more time and I swear I'm gonna 
SNAP! (I'm gonna snap) I'm gonna snap! (I'm gonna snap)I'm gonna snap! (I'm 
gonna snap) Gonna snap! ( gonna snap)I'm gonna snap! (I'm gonna snap)I'm 
gonna snap! (I'm gonna snap)I'm gonna snap! (I'm gonna snap) 
I'm gonna snap! ( gonna snap) 

1, 2, Look out behind you 
Bitch, gonna be on all you 
Peace suffocates their freedom 
This'll better me, a part of me
You were a par and a nag
Thinkin' that you lost, my friend 
It doesn't matter what price, you win
Blood, sweat, and bastard-size
