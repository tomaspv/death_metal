You know the heart sometimes cries
and nobody realizes because it is not seen
it hurts all and these single one inside
to you it is that I arrive the moment
for growing The life puts tests to
your step some they hurt to you
and they make you fall
I will always be to your side perhaps
I will catch a light
and To be able to you to see
I have the heart with Holes
and me I cannot cure me this dying
of a Few with each pain
one dies more If your heart has Holes
meetings we can help
it we are going to cure
it with mimo and by far love will
be healed It heals,
heals heart with Holes It heals,
heals we filled it of little kisses it heals
, heals heart with desire
if it does not heal today it will heal tomorrow It heals
, heals heart with Holes It heals,
heals we filled it of little kisses it heals,
heals heart with desire if
it does not heal today it will heal tomorrow
You know rain is weeping
of the life that it cries because
has thousand wounded
ones later it comes Filling winds
and it always leaves color and light
the sun I have the hear
t with holes and me I cannot
cure me this dying of a few with
each pain one dies more If
your heart has holes meetings we
can help it we are going to cure it with mimo
and by far love will be healed It heals,
heals heart with Holes It heals,
heals we filled it of little kisses
it heals heals heart with desire
if it does not heal today it will heal tomorrow It heals,
heals heart with holes It heals,
heals we filled it of little kisses
it heals heals heart with desire
if it does not heal today it will
heal tomorrow It heals,
