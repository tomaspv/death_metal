1. Prowler
[Steve Harris]

Walking through the city, looking oh so pretty,
I've just got to find my way.
See the ladies flashing. All their legs and lashes.
I've just got to find my way.

Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it open wide.
What you seeing girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it,
Can't you believe your eyes?
It's the real thing girl.

Got me feeling myself and reeling around,
Got me talking but feel like walking around.
Got me feeling myself and reeling a...
Got me talking but nothing's with me...
Got me feeling myself and reeling around.

2. Sanctuary
[Harris / Murray/ Di'Anno]

Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before
But I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law

I met up with a stranger last night
To keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling
And guns to survive
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law

[CHORUS]
So give me Sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me Sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight...tonight

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law

[CHORUS]

I can laugh at the wind
I can howl at the rain
Down in the canyon or out on the plains

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law

[CHORUS]

3. Remember Tomorrow
[Steve Harris and Paul Di'anno]

Unchain the colours before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of fire.

Tears for rememberance, and tears for joy,
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.

Unchain the colours before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of fire.

4. Running Free
[Steve Harris and Paul Di'anno]

Just sixteen, a pickup truck, out of money, out of luck.
I've got nowhere to call my own, hit the gas, and here I go.

[Chorus]
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free.
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free.

Spent the night in an L. A. jail, and listened to the sirens wail.
They ain't got a thing on me, I'm running wild, I'm running free.

[Chorus]

Puller here at the Bottle Top, whiskey, dancing, disco hop.
Now all the boys are after me, and that's the way it's gonna be

[Chorus]

5. Phantom Of The Opera
[Steve Harris]

I've been looking so long for you now you won't get away from my grasp.
You've been living so long in hiding in hiding behind that false mask.
And you know and I know that you ain't got long now to last.
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past.

You're standing in the wings, there you wait for the curtain to fall.
Knowing the terror and holding you have on us all.
Yeah, I know that you're gonna scratch me, maim me and maul.
You know I'm helpless from your mesmerising cat call.

Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait.
Don't you stray, don't fade away.
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may.
Don't you stray, from the narrow way.

I'm running and hiding in my dreams you're always there.
You're the Phantom of the Opera, you're the devil, you're just out to scare.
You damaged my mind and my soul it just floats through the air.
Haunt me, you taunt me, you torture me back at your lair.

6. Transylvania
[Instrumental]
7. Strange World
[Steve Harris]

The only place where you can dream, living here is not what it seems.
Ship of white light in the sky, nobody there to reason why.
Here I am, I'm not really there, smiling faces ever so rare.
A let's walk in deepest space, living here just isn't the place.

Stalks of light come from the ground, when I cry there isn't a sound.
All my feelings cannot be held, I'm happy in my new strange world.
Shades of green grasses twine, girls drinking plasma wine.
A look at love, a dream unfolds, living here, you'll never grow old.

Don't you hear me call? Ooh

8. Charlotte The Harlot
[Dave Murray]

Giving a swish with your arse in the air, don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte you're so refined when you take all the love that they're giving.
Sticking with every man that you find, don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air, don't you hear all the laughter?

[Chorus]
Charlotte the Harlot show me your legs,
Charlotte the Harlot take me to bed.
Charlotte the Harlot let me see blood,
Charlotte the Harlot let me see love.

Taking so many men to your room, don't you feel no remorse?
You charge them a "fiver", It's only for starters.
And ten for the main course.
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago.
Don't you care who you let in?
And don't you know you're breaking the law with the service you're giving.

[Chorus]

There was a time when you left me standing there,
Picking up pieces of love off the floor.
Well Charlotte you left me alone in there,
To make your ends as a bloody whore.
Well Charlotte you told me you love me true,
Picking up pieces of love yesterday.
Well Charlotte your draws are off color too
'Cause you're making love all day.

Giving a swish with your arse in the air, don't you know what they're saying?
Charlotte you're so refined when you take all the love that they're giving.
Sticking with every man that you find, don't you know what they're after?
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air, don't you hear all the laughter?

[Chorus]

9. Iron Maiden
[Paul Di'Anno]

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares.
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare.
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor.
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought.

[Chorus]
Oh Well, wherever, wherever you are,
Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far.
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head.
Iron Maiden wants you for dead.

Won't you come into my room, I wanna show you all my wares.
I just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare.
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor.
Iron Maiden can't be fought, Iron Maiden can't be sought.

1. Where Eagles Dare
[Harris]

It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
of engines roar in the night,
The mission is near the confident men
are waiting to drop from the sky.

The Blizzard goes on but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare.

Bavarian alps that lay all around
they seem to stare from below,
The enemy lines a long time passed
are lying deep in the snow.

Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare.

They're closing in the fortress is near
it's standing high in the sky,
The cable car's the only way in
it's really impossible to climb.

They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day.

The panicking cries the roaring of guns
are echoing all around the valley,
The mission complete they make to escape
away from the Eagles Nest.

They dared to go where no one would try
they chose to fly where eagles dare.

2. Revelations
[Dickinson]

"O God of Earth and Altar,
Bow down and hear our cry,
Our earthly rulers falter,
Our people drift and die,
The walls of gold entomb us,
The swords of scorn divide,
Take not thy thunder from us,
Take away our pride."
[G.K. Chesterton: English Hymnal]

Just a babe in a black abyss,
No reason for a place like this,
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,
An easy way for the blind to go,
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the Hanged Man - the smile of his lips.

The light of the Blind - you'll see,
The venom tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.

She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips,
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
So we lay in a black embrace,
And the Seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the Dawn.

The light of the Blind - you'll see,
The venom that tears my spine,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.

Go

Bind all of us together,
Ablaze with Hope and Free,
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see.
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain,
For the one who will be King
Is the Watcher in the Ring.
It is You.
It is You.

3. Flight Of Icarus
[Smith/Dickinson]

As the sun breaks, above the ground,
An old man stands on the hill.
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still.

His eyes are ablaze,
See the madman in his gaze.

Fly on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly and touch the sun.

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly.

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream.
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave

Fly, on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun.
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly, touch the sun
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly

Fly as high as the sun.

4. Die With Your Boots On
[Smith / Dickinson / Harris]

Another prophet of disaster
Who says the ship is lost,
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost.

Taunting us with visions,
Afflicting us with fear,
Predicting war for millions,
In the hope that one appears.

No point asking when it is,
No point asking who's to go,
No point asking what's the game,
No point asking who's to blame,

'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well, stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well, stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

13 the beast is rising,
The Frenchman did surmise,
Through earthquakes and starvation,
The warlord will arise,

Terror, death, destruction,
Pour from the eastern sands,
But the truth of all predictions
Is always in your hands.

No point asking when it is,
No point asking who's to go,
No point asking what's the game,
No point asking who's to blame,

'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well, stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

You're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well, stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

They die with their boots on,
Yes, they die.

The day, they die with their boots on
The day we die, we die, we die, we die, we die

No point asking when it is,
No point asking who's to go,
No point asking what's the game,
No point asking who's to blame,

'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,
If you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, try, stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on,
If you're gonna try, well, stick around,
Gonna cry, just move along,
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die.

Die!

5. The Trooper
[Harris]

You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back.

The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death.

The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall.

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day.

We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below.

And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan.

6. Still Life
[Murray/Harris]

Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me.

Oh.....I've never felt so strange
But.....I'm not going insane.

I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do.

Oh.....they drain my strength away
Oh.....they're asking me to stay.

Nightmares.....spirits calling me
Nightmares.....they won't leave me be.

All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool.

Now.....I feel they are so near
I.....begin to see them clear

Nightmares.....coming all the time
Nightmares.....Will give me peace of mind.

Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too.

Oh.....we'll drown together
It.....will be forever.

Nightmares.....forever calling me
Nightmares.....Now we rest in peace.

7. Quest For Fire
[Harris]

In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam.

Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
to save the power of warmth and light.

Drawn by Quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by Quest for fire
Discovery of man.

And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.

So they ploughed through forest and swamps of danger
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of life and heat.

Drawn by Quest for fire
They searched across the land
Drawn by Quest for fire
Discovery of man.

8. Sun And Steel
[Dickinson / Smith]

Well, you killed your first man at 13,
Killer instinct, Animal supreme,
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right.

Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel

Through earth and water, fire and wind,
You came at last - nothing was the end,
Make a cut by fire and stones,
Take you and your blade and break you both
in two - break you both in two.

Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel rolling on and on.

9. To Tame A Land
[Harris]

He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow.

He rules the sand worms and the Fremen
In the land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow.

He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
In the land called "Planet Dune".

Bodywater is your life
And without it you would die
In the desert, the planet Dune.

Without a stillsuit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis.

It is a land that's rich in spice
The sandriders and the "mice"
That they call the "Muad Dib".

He is the Kwizatz Haderach.
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar.

He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars.

The time will come for him to lay claim his crown,
And then the foe
Yes, they'll be cut down,
You'll see
He'll be
The best that there's been,
Messiah supreme
True leader of men,

And when the time for judgement's at hand,
Don't fret.
He's strong
He'll make a stand
'Gainst evil
The fire that spreads through the land,
He has the power to make it all end.

*******************************************

1. From Here For Eternity
[Harris]

She fell in love with his greasy machine
She leaned over wiped his kickstart clean
She'd never seen the beast before
But she left there wanting more more more

But when she was walking on down the road
She heard a sound that made her heart explode
He whispered to her to get on the back
"I'll take you on ride from here to eternity"

[Chorus (x2):]
Hell ain't a bad place
Hell is from here to eternity

She must be having one of her crazy dreams
She'd never sat on a piece so mean
It vvmade her feel like's she's on cloud nine
She even thought she heard the engine sign

But like all dreams that come to an end
They took a tumble at the devil's bend
The beast and Charlotte they were two of a kind
They'd always take the line... from here to eternity

[Chorus (x2)]

2. I Can't See My Feelings
[Budgie cover]

I can't see my feelings,
Open my eyes
I can't see my feelings,
Up in the pale moonlight

I can't see my feelings,
Keeping me high
I just keep on reeling,
Honey please tell me why

I can't stand there dreaming,
All of the time
Music sends a feeling
Up in the pale moonlight

[Solo : Dave Murray]
[Solo : Janick Gers]

3. Roll Over Vic Vella
[Chuck Berry cover]

[Vic:]
...well.

[Steve:]
Oh yeah?

[Vic:]
Went down ten feet, got a JCB from the road 'cause my other one wouldn't reach. Dug it out... after ten or fifteen minutes he went back to the hole to check the height... full of water! Must have come from the river, eh?

[Steve:]
Dunno...someone must have pissed in it.

[Vic:]
Say well, fucking big piss... somebody did.

[Someone:]
Something you were doing down the

[Vic:]
Trying to feed it through the ground, it's like a well. About three feet deep So I....that's right, fucking John shit himself. There was soil, it's like quicksand.... he went down there to spread the fucking soil, and he's sinking in, isn't he. He suddenly reached for the fucking fork lift and I lifted up he couldn't reach it... he was shitting himself. He was just going by the at the end of the boots. He said "I'm fucking going, I'm going! Just lower the fucking forklift quick!" And he grabbed hold of it, so I had to lift it up with him hanging on the end of it. Good job he didn't let go otherwise right in the fucking mud!

[Solo: Dave Murray]

Gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local MP
He's a Maltese man and he's mowing the lawn my way
Roll over Vic Vella, give me more bales of hay

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you mow that lawn my way

Early in the morning I'm giving you a warning

Don't you step on my tractor blades
Hey devil he's on the fiddle
and he ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Vic Vella, tell the tax man the bad news

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you tell the tax man the news

You want to buy a truck and need a new VCR

Vic he gonna say he knows where they are
Roll over Vic Vella, I see that panda-car

[Solo: Dave Murray]

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you play those games with me

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you play those games with me

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella
Roll over Vic Vella, don't you play that game with me

4. No Prayer For The Dying (Live)
There are times when I've wondered
And times when I've cried
When my prayers they were answered
At times when I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would I tell you the truth
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose

When I've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me
Just what my life means
Walking a long road
Never reaching the end

God give me the answer to my life
God give me the answer to my dreams
God give me the answer to my prayers
God give me the answer to my being

5. Public Enema Number One (Live)
When it all comes down the line,
And the lights they turn to greed
And you race off with your tires screaming
Rolling Thunder,
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got your fast bullet,
One way ticket outta here

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its way
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

In the cities in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and Riots
Politicians gamble and lie to save their skins
And the Press get fed the scapegoats
Public Enema number one

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its way
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell ya
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the Earth dies screaming

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its way
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain
