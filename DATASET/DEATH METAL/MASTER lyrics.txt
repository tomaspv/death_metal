1. What Kind Of God
What kind of god is senseless and weak
A product of mans own disease
Tormenting with lust, hatred and envy
A product of weakness that is worshipped daily

Funeral full of enemies
Watch the family gather stones
Funeral full of enemies
Victimised I'm left alone

What kind of god would just overlook this
What kind of god is just simply so sick
What kind of god could we put our thrust in
What kind of god is so ruthless and vain

Funeral full of enemies
The finger points to only one

Funeral full of enemies
They shift the blame to only one

What kind of god would just overlook this
What kind of god is just simply so sick
What kind of god could we put our thrust in
What kind of god is so ruthless and vain

Funeral full of enemies
Watch the family gather stones
Funeral full of enemies
Victimised I'm left alone

What kind of god would just overlook this
What kind of god is just simply so sick
What kind of god could we put our thrust in
What kind of god is so ruthless and vain

2. Latitudinarian
Latitudinarian, the minds open
Latitudinarian, the minds spoken

Sacrifice
Hypnotise
Justify
Bathe in blood
Sympathise
Exorcise
Empathise
Rituals
Rituals

Latitudinarian, the minds open
Latitudinarian, the minds spoken

Crucify
Sanctify
Multiply
Religious wars
Disinfect
Resurrect
In affect
Principals

Latitudinarian, the minds open
Latitudinarian, the minds spoken

Latitudinarian, it's pathetic
Latitudinarian, it's genetics

3. Heathen
The streets and the cities
The alleys of woe
The forces of hatred
Are out of control

The lurk in the fields
Alone in the night
A sickly perversion, excursion
That's not in sight

[Bible passage]

He travels he streets
Different weapons in hand
He searches for victims
Befriends the demand
Ridding the world of
The homeless disease
Laughing out loudly
Ignoring their pleas

Victims of the chosen
Have been clearly marked and pushed aside

Many body parts were frozen
Simply just a waste of life

Eating the flesh of the virgins
The taste of blood
Picking the brains of desertion
Forever more
Stabbing the hearts of the weakened society
Killing the worthless for pleasure now

Raping the dead it's so silent
A twist of fate
A wave of sick violence
A question of give and take

Taxpayers earning just
Feed them the deathly row
The chair gathers dust
As they age in their cell

Documented murders often

Skip the press and go unsolved
Morbid visions, gross divisions
Multiply the cause of death

You fucking heathen!
Go back to hell, where you fucking came from!

4. Used
Pushed aside and left behind
Used again a second time
Built my trust and slipped away
Just to call another day

Used, Abuse, Misused, You loose
Erased, Misplaced, Disgraced, You've changed

A pedestal of godliness
Pulled the rug under my feet

Used, Abuse, Misused, You loose
Erased, Misplaced, Disgraced, You've changed

5. Demon
Left us midway through
A cowardly way out
The alcoholic way
A loser there's no doubt
A weakling in disguise
He's 31 years old
Supported by his friends
He'll never leave his home

Guided by his peers
A follower at best
Success his only fear
He'll never lead the rest

His demon is his crutch
In life he has no clue
Consuming way to much
And acting like a fool

Left us midway through
A cowardly way out
The alcoholic way
A loser there's no doubt
A weakling in disguise

He's 31 years old
Supported by his friends
He'll never leave his home

6. Constant Quarrel
Life's uncertainty
The age of constant quarrel
Undying loyalty
Will this foot the bill

Relapse
Fall back
Repress
Collapse

Spent prophets reassure
A sense of false belief
Often to endure
A possible reprieve

Walk away
Never return
Walk away
Never learn

Promises of grandeur
I seen it in their eyes
The telephone stopped ringing
The moneys been disguised

Walk away
Never return
Walk away
Never learn

Life's uncertainty
The age of constant quarrel

Undying loyalty
Will this foot the bill

Relapse
Fall back
Repress
Collapse

Walk away
Never return
Walk away
Never learn

7. Judgement Of Will
Worth more dead
Worth more dead than alive
It's often said
The judgement of will will decide
Plot to kill
A feeling that we've been deprived

Those insurance policies
Forcing murder violently
We've assumed the monthly plan
We're accustomed to demand

Money spent
The bills of the trust must be paid
Sickness bent
The worth of the man not his fate

Those insurance policies
Forcing murder violently
We've assumed the monthly plan
We're accustomed to demand

Worth more dead
Worth more dead than alive
It's often said
The judgement of will will decide

Worth more dead

8. America The Pitiful
Oh pitiful for smoggy skies
With amber lanes of waste
With Dreadful mountain poverty's
So many infants slain

America, America
God shed his wrath on thee
No livelihood, It's just not good
From sea to blackened sea

Time ticks away, but still they play
With plans of conquering
The industry, they think they're free
Toy soldiers of the damned

America, America
God shed his death on thee
No livelihood, it's just not good
From sea to blackened sea

Oh Beautiful for spacious skies

With amber waves of grain
With purple mountain majesties
Above the fruited plain

America, America
God shed his grace on thee
With crown thy hood and brotherhood
From sea to shining sea

9. Who Is Left To Decide
Existence of his precence is his goal
Flawless lessons strengthen his control
Illustrations rest upon the walls
Worship him but soon the devil calls

Pledge to the one, the one who wallows
Worship the son, son of sorrow
Pledge to the one, the one who follows
Worship the son, no tomorrow

The hopes and the dreams
Of the one who achieves
Pleasures of flesh
They'll be down on their knees
Father and daughters
The bond will erase
Tortures of fires
The smile on his face

They threat no existence
Involves many forms
The thought of resistance
The power forewarns

Evil verses sorrow in our lives
Borrowing the souls left to decide
Afterlife a question no replies
A fallacy the preacher has no eyes

Pledge to the one, the one who wallows
Worship the son, son of sorrow
Pledge to the one, the one who follows
Worship the son, no tomorrow

Look at the graves of the thousands who've died
No one remembers who is left to decide
The flowers have wilted the maggots arrive

Who the hell cares where you go when you die
The church is in ruins the memories erased
The preacher will die and I spit in his face

10. Submerged In Sin
Implement, irreligion yellowbrick roads
Atheist, nonbelievers do they suppose
Fantasies concrete pillars demonic play
Warranty souls forgotten, could we expire

The rime is thin
Submerged in sin
Will they transpire
The lake of fire

Diligent perseverance, earthly unrest
Cautiously many footsteps, could be the last
Age ascends quick upon us, who will descend
Questions of life external, who'll reprimand

The rime is thin
Submerged in sin

Will they transpire
The lake of fire

Implement, irreligion yellowbrick roads
Atheist, nonbelievers do they suppose
Fantasies concrete pillars demonic play
Warranty souls forgotten, could we expire

The rime is thin
Submerged in sin
Will they transpire
The lake of fire

* album: "Faith Is In Season" (1998) *
**************************************

1. Follow Jesus
The force of addiction can leave a man scorned,
Soon drunk with power.
They'll then fuel his storm,
The thoughts of an infant will soon fascinate,
As time passes on, and he molds a new race,
The demons of life left them lonely and scarred,
They reached for success, and altered their fate,
They'd given up their lives, on that infamous day.
Man beleved he was truly sincere,
The epitome of saviors are born every year,
The modern day Jesus had deceived them all,
Their lord and their master were simply so small

[Chorus]
Alice doesn't live any more,
David thought he'd even up his rage,
They followed Jesus to an early grave.

2. Cast The First Stone
Out of the kingdom of darknes,
And into the kingdom of Christ,
Pray the great prayer of the scriptures,
Assure that you will be saved,

[Chorus]
The rapture is coming,
Pray for your friends
Will his arms open, will you be denied
The fires appoaching from ether,
The revelation soon fulfilled, An infant born to lead the people,
Working freely in our world

[Chorus]

Let he who is without sin then
The cast the stone,
He will lead the people triumphantly
To the new home, Will he set the captives free and
Those enslaved in sin,
He will save the Christians from The enemies til the end.

3. Addicted To The Pistol
Expect the unexpected,
When gambling wuth your life,
The points are all connected,
I've seen it in his eyes,

[Chorus]
Is it worth your freedom,
To steal the daily fix,
It's difficult in this life,
To stand up to exist
Addicted to the pistol,
It's crippling your mind,
Someone blew the whistle,
And now your doing time

[Repeat Chorus]

4. Imprisoned
So many are imprisoned,
Copnfined inside themselves
Drawn the conclusions,
In their private bell
Hiding from the challenge,
The power to live free
Lacking any virtues,
Ability to feed
The lessons in denial,
Among the field of dreams
Illustrate survival,
And life among the weak
The world is everchanging,
Don't fall into the void
Step in the arena,
And let them hear your voice
Hiding from the shadows,
A weakness that's sincere
Your living in denial,
The stress of constant fear.

5. Re-Terrorizer
Inside the building strategically placed
The plan is set forth to wipe out or erase
The victims unknowinly enter the door
The limbs are all mangled strewn out on the floor
The law is two sided the victims have rights
The rights of the victims are often ignored
The prisioners life is spent behind closed doors

[Chorus]
Terrorizer his face is weel know
Terrorizer the world is his throne
Many lives lost and who carries the cost
As the freindly skies suffer their fate
The outbreak of silence condoning the violence
The meak will all suffer their fate

[Chorus]

Re-Terrorizer his face is well known
Re-terrorizer the world is his thrown.

6. We're About To Fall
Anger is mixing with terror,
Police always lining the streets,
Searching for endless adventures,
Stalking the land of the free,

[Chorus]
We're about to fall,
There's nothing left today,
We're about fall,
No-one will fuckin be saved,
There's talk about facing the nation,
It's chilling when it's face to face,
An idol that's been just a puppet.
Where violence is just common place.

[Repeat Chorus]

7. Believers Have A Choice
Bloodles battles are raging,
In the arena of minds,
Crimes of deceit perpetrating,
Forcefeeding poisonous lies,
Misinformation is a virus,
Infecting the following herd,
The age of control is upon us,
Caged with ideas,
And chaimed by words,

[Chorus]
This has been a test,
Do not adjust your set,
Believers have a choice,
To follow or be lead,
It can't be a lie or a misprint,
Ive seen it here in black and white, In television we're trusting,
The power to teach wrong and right,
You need not share your opinion,
One will be given too you,
Sit down and shut up,
And wait for instructions,
You will be told what to do

[Chorus]

Please disregard all the vermin,
Those who speak not the good word,
Media lords will determinate,
All that is fit to be heard,
Now we return to our program,
Allready in progress you see,
Listen and lay close,
Sit down and shut up,
And be glad that your free

8. Faith Is Still In Season
Pray to god almighty,
Ask him for a chance,
Will you find the reason,
Will you soon advance,
Ask the fallen angel,
You can make a choice Will you find the answer,
Ask your inner voice,

[Chorus]
Faith is still in season,
The world is terrified,
In these times of crisis,
The faith is still alive,
Is seeing is believing,
Then I have yet to see, the world has been decieving,
Have you heard the noise,

[Repeat Chorus]

9. Broken Promise
Thousands have died and they show no remorse,
Chose to become victims without recourse,
Madmen and fools are the children of God,
Emotionless creatures an evil facade,
Broken promise Broken promise,
Look in their eyes they die see they're only fools,
Lies and disguises that fly in the face of truth,
Who'll reprimand as their hands twist the face of man,
Who, ll pay the price with their lives when it's in demand,

Repeat Last Verse

10. Where Are You Now?
Run run away, try to scape from the dark chequered past
Live for today, tomorrow is changing, and nothing will last
Lord of this world, where are you now?
Quick draw the line, the question of future is always the same
Symphonies of hate, the disease of faith is a question of time
Who will replace, the vision of he who will soon sacrifice

[Chorus]
Lord of this world, where are you now, a simple illusion,
A really good show,
It's the magician, or is this religion
Thr face with no name, the clear jar of flies

11. Butchered By Numbers
Families are ruined, blood has been spilled
Did Timothy do it, it was his free will
Butchered by numbers, his silent stoned face
Some were survivors, to his dismay
Militias preparing for governments rage,
He learned from the teacher,
He's setting the stage

[Chorus]
Stop pointing the finger, just look in the mirror
The end of your freedom,
It's drwing near
Supporting suppression, infringes your rights
Extort the confession, get ready to fight

[Repeat Chorus]

12. Antidote
I have seen the light, and I have changed my ways
I have learned to live, to fight for every day
I've found inside, the will to face my fear

[Chorus]
Do you want to die, I have the antidote
Do you want to die, has your life been so remote?
Contemplate the way, attempt the suicide,
We'll suply the means, the means to end your life
Is paradise in hell, has heaven been on earth?
Only time will tell, what your life's been worth

[Repeat Chorus]

Has your life been one big joke?

13. Spiritual Bankruptcy
There's a killer loose and a price on yor life,
There's a liar who tells you what's wrong or right,
The asylm's full and it's locked from outside,
Soul in bankruptcy just for the ride

[Chorus]
Follow the trail,
It's everywhere you want to be,
Work every day like a slave,
So you can afford to be free

14. Victims Of Jesus
Victims of Jesus, they stand by his side
Predicting the future, absorbing his lies
Bent on redemption, exploiting their faith
Claim a connection, the great christian race
Hail to the preacher, the richest one
Send your donations, support his sons
His promise to save you, just stand in line
Will he decieve you, or make time
Stand in his honor, their faith is their claim
Look over yonder, there is nothing to gain

15. Return To Vietnam
Their killing for ideals, to build your perfect world,
Their marching toward their death, with the flag unfurled
Support the national pride, to reach their ignorant goals
Their fighting to survive, the fight for all control
Step into seclusion, hide beneathe the brush,
It's the code of honor, nothing to discuss
Your fates in the hands of those who pull your strings
Are they drunk with power, or lonely human beings
Mesmerize the chosen, critisize desertion,
Publicize the moment, just coersion
Soldiers fill the streets, they're marching off to war,
In the Bosnian freeze, a massage to explore

[Chorus]
Old men make mistakes and soon the young men pay
Sacrifice the day with their lives Return to Vietnam, the parallel is the same
The object is to win or lose this deadly game

16. Previously Commited
[Instrumental]






*********************************************
* album: "Four More Years Of Terror" (2005) *
*********************************************

1. Race To Extinction
Blood red faces
Through the ages
Advantageous
To white races

Sights on invention
Race to extinction
Fights for ascention
Face the depletion

Expulsion of the sick and twisted
Reprisals if their not convicted
Unleashed upon the newest faction
Removal from this chain reaction

2. Shoot To Kill
Step on the toes of the righteous
The dignified pigs we deplore
In previous years they'd incite us
But once bitten not anymore
Intent on distorting their words
Indulging in such complication
Often unseen and unheard

Elections are fixed animations
Deceptions are filled with rewards
The sick suicidal encroachment
The timing we cannot afford

We're face with an authorization
The license to just shoot and kill
The innocent are presumed guilty
Officially mistakes are nil

Endangered, The species of deception
Angered, The victims of oppression
Endangered, The thoughts are all misguided
Angered, A world that's all one sided

3. All We've Become
Breaking away from the mistakes we've made
Can we escape from all we've become
After the combat can we ever go back
Will freedom ever be the same
Or will Big Brother look over my shoulder
And dictate the way we should live
Soon they'll discover but will they uncover
The sins of the ones to forgive

The Beast Within
Can God explain how this began
The Beast Within
Such power from such mortal men
The Beast Within
The pride the force the negligence
The Beast Within
Shall we let the prayer's commence

Just look around at the walls that surround
Can we escape from all we've become
Or will a camera replace the stammerer
as he prepares to spill blood

4. Does One Feel Pain
No one is safe from the terrorist's fate
Was England dreaming during the GB
One day a winner a loser the next
After the summit what can we expect

Why don't they,Can't they see, Does one feel pain

Political progress can end in defeat
Commitment's are broken with different beliefs
Leaders make promises they cannot keep
Pockets are filled with their lies and deciet

A mirrored image of the past mistakes
Can our leaders all expect the blame
In silence the majority invades
Distorted values never are explained
Skepticism leads us all astray
After such attacks will there be change
For years such silent fits have been ignored
2005 the year of our dear Lord

Life sustains wealth
All remain in hell

5. Betrayal
He walked away, ever since there was a final trial
Nothing was said, nothing was revealed behind the smile
No proof of the crime, while the victims suffered in denial
A sign of the times, would the killer soon reveal his style

Trapped, Trapped, There is no escape
Trapped, Trapped, In this life of pain
The science of fools, Dr.Keller crafted his own vision
So often subdued, No-one contradicted his decisions
With limited space, experimenting with imprisoned humans
Simply maintained, Freedoms found in ways, so just excuse him

Betrayal, Betrayal
Watch as victims pacify and slowly die

6. Hell Probably Win
Watch as his mind slips away
Will he survive one more day
A testimony of uncompromising will
Certainly a large void to fill

Look out, Look out
The puppet is pulling its strings
Look out, Look out
As fate has it, he'll probably win

Emotional sickness prevails
Sometimes a secret that ails
A faith in a superior one
It's ended, before it's begun

7. Can The Us Be So Great
Is the land free if it's ruled by the state
Different's not good as they cannot relate
The arm of the law within reach will invade
Will cell research a superior race

Fuck the USA today, An evil land that's filled with hat
Can the US be so great, When thousand's die in every state

The rich all get richer and never protest
When laws are created that do not exist
Then all-for-one becomes just-one-for-all
Four year and counting prepare for the fall

8. Lined Up And Punished
Forcing democracy, and losing the game
Bush's hypocracy, we should refrain
Lined up and punished, is this what's called free
American Justice, it's time to delete

Why, Why,Why, Why

Presence and force, the only way
Social recourse, a show of strength
Us or bust, stand up and shout
Can they lead us, the few the proud

I'll take your life

9. Blind Hatred
Americans have often been disliked
The end of terror is nowhere in sight
Supporting the Al Quaida no one knows
100 comb the streets as they explode

Hatred, Blind Hatred
Four more years of terror

A war based on deception is this right?
Insurgents line up to engage and fight
As blood flows Urban warfare shows its might
The citizens of Irak have no rights

10. Line To Kill
As I looked into the eyes of God
I thought I saw, saw it all
The prophecy soon fulfilled
Forming the line,line to kill

Crucify Christ, Turn day into night

Counting the days to forgive
Thinking of ways, ways to live
I stepped into the abyss
And I saw you, I insist

Crucify Christ, Turn day into night
Take Bush's advice

11. Special Skills
All-for-one and we're one-for-all
A twist on fate, but who's keeping score
Suicide such an evil game
Detonate and nothing will remain

For the cause of violence we kill
No one will abide by our own will
Many things we learned in special skills
No one can dictate what we will do

12. To Fight And Die
They fight for the right to engage
In war all the world is a stage
As cities are tested we wait
For Blair to complete his tirade
The casualties soon will out way
The triumph supposedly made
With George just assume we'll invade
With Donald there's nothing at stake

Creating enemies is what the US can do best
In silence contemplating profits, where they should strike next
Designing strategems to hide the truth from all the rest
The old man leading young men to embrace their violent death

Get up to march, to fight and die

Lock and load your rifle Soldier, Are we really in denial
Lock and load your rifle Soldier, No-one can expect a trial

13. Everything Is Rotten
There has been a gross injustice
The guilty headed to a distant shore
Soon the media discussed this
Black Thursday would open up a door
Self absorbed no pain no sorrow
The rhythm of destruction played its beat
Was suicide the only motive
While body parts were gathered in the streets

Lies, Everything is rotten
Lies, Do you think I have forgotten
Lies, It's the day of reckoning
Lies, Everything has been so deafening
