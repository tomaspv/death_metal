1. Prime Evil
Prime,the first evolutionary plan,that spawned the first ever Superstition of man,
God created every atom that lives,but was he really there at all?
Evil,in every satanic scroll,In different forms to every race and blacker than coal,
He doth destroy every atom that lives but is  he really there at all?

The Holy scribes fortold the destiny of man,
Living coldly on the earth, disrupting ancient plans.
Well is this what we are and what we have become,
Or is the only tie ,the way we die and how we had begun?

Prime Evil,an evolutionary call,
Prime Evil,quenched in the fires of their souls,
Prime Evil,you'll never see the sun again!

Danger,Danger,that's the human call,
Growing strong and aging wise,the race can only fall,
Well is this Holy anger,bleached upon our souls,
Is this the Evil One, satan's son, gabriel's foe?

Prime Evil,an evolutionary call,
Prime Evil,quenched in the fires of their souls,
Prime Evil,you'll never see the sun again!

[SOLO/Guitar]

Prime Evil,an evolutionary call,
Prime Evil,quenched in the fires of their souls,
Prime Evil,you'll never see the sun again!
[Repeat]

Prime Evil,
Quenched in the fires of their souls.
Prime Evil,
You'll never see the sun again!
Prime Evil.

2. Parasite
There was a time when hunger was mine,you'd walk the line.
You sowed the seed, your making us need,your watching us bleed,you bastard!
We always felt you were a better friend,with your riches and your smiles,
You helped me keep the wolves from the door,
You filled our heads so full of,Lies!
We always felt you were a better friend,with your iches and your smiles,
You helped to keep the wolves from the door,
You filled our heads so full of,Lies!

Parasite!
Parasite!

Life was a ball and you took it all,
We took a fall,
You were the doubt
You won't bail us out,there's no use to shout,Your dying!
We always felt you were a better friend,with your riches and your smiles,
You helped to keep the wolves from the door,
You filled our heads so full of,Lies!
We always felt you were a better friend,with your riches and your smiles,
You helped to keep the wolves from the door,
You filled our heads so full of,Lies!

Parasite!

A toffee for the kiddies,sugar and spice,
Just wait a minute fella,your anything but nice!
We always felt you were a better friend,with your riches and your smiles,
You helped to keep the wolves from the door,
You filled our heads so full of,Lies,
[Repeat]

Parasite!

3. Blackened Are The Priests
Requiem Eternum,Lord of Ancients,Son of God.
Requiem Eternal,Buried in this Holy Ground.

They pray on heaven and on fire,deliver them from evil,Death.
Their keys that keep their secret safe, are lost in war and now, they pay the price!

They cannot be freed!They cry but there's no other way, to free them.
Blackened are the Priests,
of evil,drinking from their chalaces of blood,redeem them,
Blackened are the Priests.

Amist the holy cries of heaven,beneath the soddened earth,hell.
The whitened collars of the dogs, that spew forth hardy thoughts ,of life,
Ah help them!

Blackened is the mantle of the Priests.
Amen!
Blackened is the collar of the Priests.
Blackened is the collar of the Priests.

The Holy alter now of heaven,cannot deliver us from pain.

(Postman pat and his Black and White cat!)

[Solo/Bass Riff]

God help them!

The holy alter now of heaven,doth not deliver them from pain.
They cannot turn their back on hell,from the grace they fell,
all their futile efforts wane.

They cannot be freed!They cry but there's no other way, to free them.
Blackened are the Priests,
of evil,drinking from their chalaces of blood,redeem them.
Blackened are the Priests,
of evil,we try but there's no other way to free them,
Blackened are the Priests,
of evil,drinking from their chalaces of blood,redeem them,
Blackened are the Priests!

4. Carnivorous
Laughing and screaming and bathing in blood.
Ripping at throats of the damned.
Lucifer's calling awakens his dogs,
Thrust from Lord Satan's left hand!

Carving our Satanic truss.
Dipped in the pure virgin soul,
feeding on us!
CARNIVEROUS!

Centuries measured by offerings made,
and openings made in the soul.
Steel razored teeth,ripping the flesh,
feeding the ultimate goal.

And making our sacrifice
hoping the lord is appeased?
and draining the life.
CARNIVEROUS!

[SOLO/Guitar]

Screaming and crying ,awakens the beast,
rising him from his dark lair.
Pulling and tearing and ripping the flesh,
Attaining the pure virgin fair.

And carving our satanic truss.
Dipped in the pure virgins soul.
CARNIVEROUS!

5. Skeletal Dance
Transparently Obvious,tactless and trite!
You give up on life mate, your not worth the fight!
We're looking right through you to see to the soul,
but sadly in your case your only a hole!

Skeletal Dance 
Skeletal Dance
Skeletal Dance
Skeletal Dance

Living your life by the end of a string,
You have to admit, it's not a great thing!
Humpties more older and Humpties more wise,
Except when he grins you'll see through the....

Skeletal Dance
Skeletal Dance
Skeletal Dance 
Skeletal Dance

Now Mickey's a Mouse so his young brother say's,
The best crimes are cowardly,crime never pays.
Violence,Destruction and Killing's the shout,
But where does he hide when the cat is about?

Skeletal Dance

6. Megalomania
[Black Sabbath/Butler/Iommi/Osbourne/Ward]

Well I feel something's taking me,I don't know where?
It's like a trip inside a seperate mind!
The ghost of tomorrow,of my favorite dream,
Is telling me to leave it all behind!

Feel it slipping away,
Slipping in tomorrow.
Gotta get to happiness,
From the depths of sorrow.

I'm alright,am I right?
As I try to get away from you now!
Am I right?I'm alright,
As I try to get away from you now!

Sting Me!

Well I feel something's giving me the chance to return,
It's giving me the chance of saving my soul.
A big bad demigod,fading away,
I'm going back to where I'm in control!

Feel it slipping away,
Slipping in tomorrow.
Getting back to Sanity,
From the depths of sorrow.

Was it wise,to disguise,
As I try to get away from you now?
Is there a way,I can pay,
Or is it true I have to stay with you now?

Was I right,Am I right,
As I try to get away from you now?
Was it wise,to disguise,
As I try to get away from you now?

Suck Me!

I'm the King of schizophrenia,the pest of the Earth,
I singed my soul in the fires of Hell!
I feel someone eluding me,
But now it's all mine!
I set the trap and it was me who fell!

Feel it slipping away,
Slipping in tomorrow.
getting back to sanity,
From the depths of sorrow.

No more lies,I got wise,I despise the way I worship you, Yeah!
Now your free,can't you see?yeah this time I won't be led by you, Yeah!

Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!

Megalomania

Megalomania

7. I Agree
Trapped inside Mazonic minds that simple thought denied,
No escape,no orifice,they're only drained through their eyes!

The mindless thoughts and afterglow,the scars that's left behind,
Drilled upon the cranium and sculpted deep in the mind!

How they writhe in pain,padded room of doom,

INSANE!

INSANE!

Pulling at the iron bars and tearing at the walls,
Screaming with Insanity but no-one hears the calls!

You know in truth your mind is clear but no-one's here to tell,
A frienzied madness echo's out inside your own brain-cell!

How they writhe in pain,
Padded room of doom!

Schizo

How they writhe in pain,
Padded room of doom,

INSANE!

A Venomous completion now is riddled through you veins,
Staring at the button padded walls,
INSANE!

Nothing left inside your head and empty, useless, tomb,
Here you live,alive, undead,inside your pillowed room!

How they writhe in pain,
Padded room of doom,
INSANE!

INSANE!

INSANE!

INSANE!

8. Harder Than Ever
You thought we'd lost it all,
You thought we'd given up the fight!

Well now we're back to prove you wrong,
It's time to open up your eyes,Hell Yeah!

Here's one for you,you thought,it's only Rock and Roll,
We're taking everything,prepare to loose your soul!

Harder Than Ever,
Hotter than hell!
Are you with us,
Legion's, iron and steel?

You want it hard,you want it fast,you want it loud,you got it all!
We take no prisoners,let 'em rot,were gonna leave them where they fall,
Hell Yeah!

We stand as one,we raise a glass to absent friends!
Bet you think you'd escaped?
Think again!!

Harder than Ever,
Hotter Than hell!
Are you with us,
Legion's, iron and steel?

Harder Than Ever,
Hotter Than Hell!
Are you with us,
Legion's,iron and steel!

We stand as one,we raise a glass to absemt friends,
Bet you think you'd escaped?
Think again!!   

Harder Than Ever,
Hotter than Hell!
Are you with us,
Legion's,iron and steel?  

Harder Than ever,
Hotter that Hell!
Are you with us,
Legion's,iron and steel?

Harder Than Ever,
Hotter than Hell!
Are you with us,
Legion's,iron and steel?

Harder,
Hotter than Hell!
Harder Than Ever!!

9. Into The Fire
Sleepless  nights,drenched in sweat.
A lust for life,endless death.

We're dancing in the fire,
We're lost in the Flame.
We're lost in  the Fire,
Nothing stays the same!

INTO THE FIRE!
INTO THE FIRE!

Day to night,night to day,
Lost in dreams,that fade away!

Into the fire,
We're dancing in the flame!
We're lost in  the fire,
Well nothing stays the same!

INTO THE FIRE!
INTO THE FIRE!

In the night,alone and dark,deep within the source,
Tourtured feel the flames of Hell, rising to the cause!

Onbe,two,three,four!

All my life,drenched in pain!
All my needs,all the same.

We're dancing in the fire,
We're lost in the falme.
Dancing in the fire,
Well nothing stays the same!

INTO THE FIRE!
INTO THE FIRE!
INTO THE FIRE!
INTO THE FIRE!
INTO THE FIRE!

10. School Daze
Remember me I was your teachers pet at school?
You taught me everything and how we broke the rules.
Well now I'm, back to show you everything I've learned.
You play with fire,
You know your getting burned!

Get 'em down,teacher,teacher get 'em down,
Oh com'on,get 'em down,oh teacher,teacher get 'em down.

OH!OH!

She got a fire raging inbetween her thighs,
I got the hose to put it out,
Try this for size!
Well teacher swallowed every inch of throbbing love!
Guess this is what they mean by,fits like a glove!

Get 'em down,teacher,teacher get 'em down,
Wow,com'on,get 'em down,Wow teacher,teacher get 'em down!

School Days,
Teacher taught me everything,
School Days,
One and one is two!
School Days
when I heard the school bell ring,
School Days,
There's nothing she won't do!

She sees how hard it gets when she lifts up her dress,
She licks her lips and says let's put it to the test?
She goes down faster than a sinking ship at sea.
I dont' need rescued, coz she's going down on me!

Going down,teachers,teachers going down,
Woe,teachers,teachers going down.
Teachers,teachers going down,woa,woa!

School Days,
Teacher taught me everything,
School Days,
One and one is two!
School Days,
When I heard that school bell ring,
School Days,
There's nothing she won't do!

She's got me poisoned,teacher's begging me for more!
Up goes the skirt again it's harder than before!
Wrap those legs around me teacher ,what else can I do?
I got this feeling............................................................Ahhhhhhhhh!

School Days,
Teacher taught me everything,
School Days,
One and one is two.

When I heard that school bell ring,

11. Live Like An Angel, Die Like A Devil






**********************************
* album: "Temples Of Ice" (1991) *
**********************************

1. Tribes
Memories fresh within my head
blood is fresh but you are dead
Cross into the freaks domain
See your fear feel your pain
The prophesy has now begun
You cannot hide you cannot run
Leave you bleeding at my feet
You are natural you are meat

Tribes
Below the graves
Breed
Refuge by day
Tribes
their home beneath
Breed
Alive but deceased

Blessed with the gift of flight
Changing shape and unseen sight
Knowing why and knowing when
Gifted with the dreams of men
Out of sight out of mind
Leave our world you're not of our kind
What he fears he can't enjoy
What man envies he destroys

Leave the garden of your torment
Through the gates that hold your fear
Monsters freaks the cursed the gifted
Day is gone the night is here

Death by fire death by gun
Death by knife death by sun

Born apart they crave the same
Living in their unreal pain
Prejudice deeper than creed
The reason for this hate is breed
Not unholy but alone
Just for this we burn their home
Banished from the world of men
Man beware they'll rise again

2. Even In Heaven
Led by a sacred feeling in my heart
I have left my evil ways to restart

Now I heard Eden call
I must try not to fall

All is good in heaven
But I want more
Am I stripped of evilness to the core

Now I hear the darkness say
Rise my son and do your work
Make them pay!

Even in heaven there's hell
Even in heaven

Brought by the holy son
Welcomed and blessed inside
Now that the dead's begun
Kneel o me or die, ha, ha, ha, ha

When the war is over
as it's just begun
Wehn your god has fallen
And Satan's work is done
I will sit at
his strong left side
with my head held high
and a wreath of pride

3. Trinity MCMXLV 0530
Here we stand as the forces blow
Across the land
Open minds and now open sores
But no open hand

Hiding in our trench of steel
To witness the blast
Nothing to say and now nothing to feel
Now it's hopeless and past

The wind that was meant to be
Oppenheimer built radioactivity

Buildings and houses crops and forethought
Have now gone to ground
All but the dust and the helpless debris
Are all that are found

Now his creation is purchased by gods
Who must reconvene
Deciding to cleanse the Earth of its life
By priming their own warmachine
Skil will grow soft blood will grow cold
But not on your frame
He mastered the deadliest weapon of all
But was he insane

He built it for life
He built it for peace
Oh that's what he thought
But evilness knows no boundaries
And satan will read from his court

4. In Memory Of (Paul Miller 1964-90)
He was in life as he was in death
A well remebered man
His life was taken like a sudden breath
that simply wasn't planned

And all that's left to say
Written on his grave it says:

In Memory Of

In all the essence of a friendship he,
was never so cold or sad
He tried so hard as he struggled in
What little time he had

No more return to home
Written on his stone it says

In Memory Of

And now he's gone all that's left behind
Is a legacy
In the pages of a magazine
Left in time to read

the only thing that's said
A memory of his life
Written at it's head it says
All this left behind

5. Faerie Tale
Gahter round and listen to
the tales I have to tell
Of demons, death and misery
In this wonderland called hell

The things that children dream of
Are present in this land
Look in my eyes and trust me
Come take my hand

The looking glass doth break
Revealing all inside
A land of joy and misery
No place for you to hide
We are your darkest fears
Faerie tale, nightmare fantasy
Keeper or souls, stealer or breath
the legions. Revel in ecstacy

The nightmares that awake you
Believe that they are real
The demons laugh and feast upon
The children's hearts they steal

Tempted into darkness
By those who would be true
Lured and deceived
by the evil that we do

Sugar and spice
and everything nice
fortune favours the chosen few
Laughter and tears
Heartache and tears
Emotional torture inside of you

Sing a song of sixpence
Mummy's going to die
Daddy is the devil
And baby's going to cry

Yu're safe with me
you wait with bated breath
the pied piper plays his song
Come follow to your death

6. Playtime
Told you the story 'bout a teather's pet
well aou ain't heard nothing yet
skooldaze over teacher thinks that's no life
skirts up, heads down, Playtime

you know I'm wanting you
I know you're wanting every inch of me
you love how hard it gets and I
love just how dirty you can be
I told her that she needs
a good stiff talking to
this conversation piece
is sure to do you good

Playtime
teacher's getting horny
reading little pornographic storys
Playtime
loving every minute
she can take it in the hilt
Playtime
teasing and pleading
she can make it harder than before
Playtime
give her all you've got
she can take it all and beg for more

silk stockings, black high heels
skirt so tight you won't believe you eyes
the way she swallows you
you'll wonder what she's got between her thighs

she is insatible
she's never satisfied
warm, wet and willing
as she welcomes you inside

she make it obvious
the things that she has got upon her mind
she needs it hard
the way she winks at you and wiggles her behind

her blouse is open
just enough to make you drool
I do my homework
with the teacher after school

7. Acid
My brain fed with ecstacy
Fills my need
As I feel my body burst with great speed
And I clench a needle in a blood drained fist
Then I turn and mark another trip off my list

Feel that rush, with that gold satanic dust
feel that pain, the drug induce through my veins

I will in life as I will in death
Sow the seeds with every breath
Never will I run, never will I hide
Only to express myself and feel it deep inside

Acid

Now I dream in comatose neuotic state
As my paranoia grows I must wait
Til the feeling of the drug starts to die
Then I'll hit the drug again, take me high

Feel that buzz, for all the goddam good it does
Feel the flight, that flies me in through day and night

Now inside my arteries there's no blood

8. Arachnid
The thouht of you has plagued my years
I see you now
Crawling all over me
Symptom of my darkest fears
With me now
Living inside of me

In the night
As you sleep
the web begins to form
Across your face to suffocate
And kill before the dawn

Arachnid

Strangely drawn towards her lair certain death,
she wants to be part of you
Lie in wait my choice of mate
I can't resist she
Bites and devours you

Lift your body
From the ground
Strech octapoidal limbs
Leave the web
Without a sound
The fantasy begins
Come into the parlour said the spider to the fly
Not really knowing that the end is drawing nigh
Making love in ecstacy, the venom she injects
Death is swift, limbs entwined amid arachnid sex

The scent you spread I know so well
could leave me dead
Hopelessly mesmerised
Your bite will mean the end to me
Can you see I'm
Helplessly hypnotised

Panic stricken
Terrified
Cocooned within the web
Arachnophobic
Misery
Release me from this living nightmare

If I stalk you must forgive me
For this dance is my chemistry

9. Speed King
Good golly said little Miss Molly
Whe she was rockin in the house of the blue light
Tooty Fruity was oh so rotty
Rockin to the east and west
Loucile was oh so real
When she didn't do her daddy's will
Come on baby, drive me crazy
You can do it, you can do it

I'm a speed king, hear me sing
Yes, I'm a speed king, see me fly
Sat night and I just got paid
Gonna fool about now aint gonna save
People gonna rock, people gonna roll
Gonna have a party to save my soul
Heard headed woman, soft heart man
they been causin trouble since it all began
Take a little rice, take a little beans
gonna rock and roll down to New Orleans

Cause I'm a speed king
hear me sing, speed king, see me fly
Good golly said little Miss Molly
Whe she was rockin in the house of the blue light
Tooty Fruity was oh so rotty
Rockin to the east and west
Heard headed woman, soft heart man
they been causin trouble since it all began
Take a little rice, take a little beans
gonna rock and roll down to New Orleans

10. Temples Of Ice
Questioning the future with flaming intent
I kneel before the temples of ice
Crystalised walls rise to 10,000 feet
Behind lies th answers to life

My cold breathless pain, makes me hunger for fire
Must forge on, must remain and fulfil my desire
Inside temples of

Running the tunnels, the icy walls scaled
I strech for the welfare of heat
Staring through clouds of my own fog-soaked breath
The challenge that I must defeat

My heart sinks in fear, as I seek but can't tell
I feel death drawing near, as I reach into hell
Here, in temples of ice

Here now, in my mind's esy
Lost my sight, my soul I find decaying into dust

ICE - Temples Of
ICE - Temples Of

1. Bloodlust
Come on turn it up!

Madness

Stalking the night
Feeding fast on my prey
Draining the life
'Till the dawn of the day
Drinking and sucking
The blood rushing sweet
Half crazed with glory
Half crazed in the heat

Bloodlust

Tearing the flesh
Of the weak and the child
Sparing no one
The meek and the mild
I sink my fangs in your
Neck as you dream
I am Count Cronos
Vampire Supreme

Bloodlust

Bloodlust upon me
I'm biting the flesh
I'll take away
Your God given breath
Now I shall feast
On your life giving blood
Leave you to die
On the land you once stood

Bloodlust

2. In Nominai Satanas
In the name of Satan
We'll achieve our goal
With the blessings of Hades
We'll outlive our role
Through the power of Hellfire
We will gather our strength
With the blood of mere mortals
Our thirst will be quenched

In the name of Satan
Great things can be done
Through the lore of the demons
Satan's song can be sung
Gather around my Legions
For in time you'll see
Mortals screaming for mercy
At the king for world war three

Hail Satanas
In nominai Deinochous
Satanas Lucifer excelsis

In the name of Satan
We'll take what we need
Rock and roll damnation
Let your heart bleed
Sensing the disaster
So we'll blame our hate
Hell bore Satan's child
To use you as our bait

Hear infernal legions plead
As Satan sings his songs of war
As I see mortal corpses rise
Up from the depths
I care not for the whore
I shall destroy the priests
Bound in chains and damned in Hell
I shall never release their souls
For the internal torment always reigns
Summon legions of the night
For we are now as one....
