2. Ethereal New Era
COMPROMISED WITH A MISTAKE
COMPROMISED WITH HUMAN RACE 
ARE WE ETHEREAL?

COMPROMISED WITH A MISTAKE
OUR HUMAN RACE IS HARMED BY OURSELVES
NO HARMONY, NO ARMONY
JUST NO PEACE AT ALL

NO ONE SEES, NO ONE WILL CARE
IF WE ARE ALIVE OR WE LIE DEAD
WE ARE KEPT AWAY FROM OUR MINDS 
CAUSE
WE ARE NOT TO SEE
WE ARE NOT TO ASK
DON'T FUCK
WE ARE TO CARE
OF OUR BACKS
WE ARE TO SHUT UP

I DON'T KNOW WHY WE ARE STERILIZED
OUR CELLS ARE ACID IN OUR MINDS
ARE WE ETHEREAL? ARE WE ETHEREAL?
OF COURSE WE ARENT NOT

WHILE OUR 'GOD' JUST LAUGHS AT US
WE TRY TO PIND A WAY TO GIVE ALL UP
I KNOW YOU ARE WRONG
I KNOW YOU ARE WRONG

GET FUCKING AWAY
AND BLEED SOME MORE

WHILE YOU KEEP DIVIDED

NO HUMAN
NO ONE'S IMMUNE TODAY

LIFE IS GUILT
LIFE IS FILTH
LIFE IS NOTHING BUT A RISK
I KILL

4. Carnivore
CARNIVORE SOCIATY
THAT ONLY FEEDS THE RICH
KEEPS ON TRYING TO HIDE OUT
OUR IDEOLOGIES
WON'T CRUCIFY OUR MINDS
WON'T CARNAGE OUR SPEECH
MASSES DON'T EXIST

CAUSE WE ARE
GETTING AWAY
FROM THIS WICKED DOCTRINE
ACUMULATE HATE
AT A TIME YOU WILL KNOW
THAT UNITED WE ARE STRONG

NO REDEMPTION TO POLICY
CAUSE WE ARE RECEIVING NOTHING
THIS IS A SYSTEM OF MISERY
THAT'S KILLING US SLOWLY
WON'T CRUCIFY OUR MINDS
WON'T CARNAGE OUR SPEECH
MASSES DON'T EXIST

CAUSE WE ARE
GETTING AWAY
FROM THIS WICKED DOCTRINE
ACUMULATE HATE
AT A TIME YOU WILL KNOW
THAT UNITED WE ARE STRONG

A CHANGE OF MIND OF ATTITUD
A CHANGE OF MIND AN INNER VIEW
(IMAGINE)
ASSAULT THE POWER
AND MAKE IT YOURS
A REVOLUTION IS BEING BORN
WON'T CRUCIFY OUR MINDS
WON'T CARNAGE OUR SPEECH
MASSES DON'T EXIST

CAUSE WE ARE
GETTING AWAY
FROM THIS WICKED DOCTRINE
ACUMULATE HATE
AT A TIME YOU WILL KNOW
THAT UNITED WE ARE STRONG

5. G.O.D. (Glamour Of Divinities)
I SAY
WHAT IS FAKE
LIFE'S MINE
IN TRUTHS AND LIES
YOU KNOW
I SIT UPON THE TRUTH
AND ALRIGHT!
YOUR FAITH IS STRONG
LIFE IS REAL
BUT SEEMS TO FADE AWAY
I PUNISH
WHEN YOU GET OUT OF WAY
I SET
LAW AND ORDER
MY NAME
YOU DON'T KNOW WELL
AND YOU CAN'T BE
ALL YOU WANNA BE
YOU'LL SEE THE THINGS THAT I WILL LET YOU SEE
LIFE IS REAL
BUT SEEMS TO FADE AWAY
I PUNISH
WHEN YOU GET OUT OF WAY
YOUR FEAR'S
THE ONE THAT MAKES ME STRONG
YOUR TEARS
WILL LET ME BE YOUR GOD
I SAY
WHAT'S RIGHT
DECIDE
WHETHER IT IS RIGHT OR WRONG
I SAY
WHAT'S RIGHT
DECIDE
IF YOU ARE ALIVE OR YOU ARE NOT
I FALL
WHEN DOUBTS ARE BORN
I CRAWL
WHEN YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED
CAUSE YOU MAKE ME BE WHEN YOU BELIEVE
I RULE BECAUSE YOU LET ME RULE YOUR FEELINGS
GOD'S A LIE THAT EXISTS
IN YOUR MIND, AN INVENTION
GOD HATES ME!
I CAN'T STAND YOUR BLINDNESS
FUCK YOUR SACRED REASONS
MEAN NOTHING
MEAN NOTHING

6. Your Inner Lachrymose
DOWNCASTED I WILL NOT WAIT I DRAG YOUR PAIN
I'VE RUN A LONG WAY FLEEDING AWAY (AGAIN)
I PROVOKE I DRAG YOUR SOUL I STOP YOUR DOWNFALL
I'VE KNOCKED OUT THE LACHRYMOSE AND I WON'T LET HIM RISE
REVENGE DO US BE I SEEK NO ARMONY
LIAR HYPOCRITE I HATE YOUR WAYS
TEARS HURT

7. Back To Basics
I CHANGED MY MIND IN ALMOST EVERY WAY
GOT DOWN TO LIFE STARTED TO LIVE AGAIN
GIVEN MY SELF ANOTHER SECOND CHANCE
THE ONLY WAY TO FEEL COMPLETE WITH ME

CHOSEN A WAY TO LIVE ASIDE THE FAKE
WORN OUT OF BEING THE ONE THAT'S ALWAYS
DESECRATED
WHAT DO YOU SEE? YOU SEE THE REAL ME
I'VE LEFT BEHIND A PAST THAT I DON'T WANT TO LIVE

PLAYING A ROLE THAT NEVER FIT WITH ME
NOW FACE MY LIFE EXACTLY HOW IT IS
FEELING DEPRESSED TO LEAVE A PLACE TO JOY
WON'T BE THE SAME A NEW WAY I HAVE DONE

CHOSEN A WAY TO LIVE ASIDE THE FAKE
WORN OUT OF BEING THE ONE THAT'S ALWAYS
DESECRATED
WHAT DO YOU SEE? YOU SEE THE REAL ME
I'VE LEFT BEHIND A PAST THAT I DON'T WANT TO LIVE

FUCK YOUR TRENDS, YOUR WAYS, YOUR LIFE
CAUSE I CAN SEE NO FUN
FUCK THE THINGS THAT I HAVE DONE
CAUSE I HAVE GOT ENOUGH

FUCK YOU SILLY PLEASURES
I REALLY PRAISE MY TIME
FUCK YOU CLOUDY FANTASIES
I WANT A REAL LIFE
I'VE BEEN SO BLIND
I LIED TO LIFE
BACK TO BASICS, BACK TO ME
I WANNA BE MYSELF
BACK TO MY RELALITY
CAUSE IT'S MINE AND NO ONE ELSE'S
I'VE BEEN SO BLIND
I LIED TO LIFE
I'VE BEEN SO BLIND
I LIED TO LIFE

8. Low Resolution Lifelines
DOWNWARDS
WE GO LIVE NOT TO SURVIVE
A CLEAR DREAM TO HUMANIZE

CAUSE I DON'T NEED
TO PLAY YOUR GAME
WHERE ARE THE THINGS
SUPPOSSED TO GAIN
BELIEVE IN ME MY FRIEND, YOU KNOW
I'M GOING HIGH WHILE YOU GO DOWN

SKIES LANDS MIND FLESH
BUILD YOUR OWN PRESENT
FOLLOW YOUR WILL A VALID WAY

CAUSE I DON'T NEED
TO PLAY YOUR GAME
WHERE ARE THE THINGS
SUPPOSSED TO GAIN
BELIEVE IN ME MY FRIEND, YOU KNOW
I'M GOING HIGH WHILE YOU GO DOWN

9. Beyond Primitive Utopias
I CAN'T LIVE MY LIFE HOW IT IS
CAUSE DECADENCE INVADES ALL MY DREAMS

WASTING TIME TO REACH OUT THE TRUTH
I REALISED THAT IT PULLS ME UNDER

BREEDING
A NEW WAY OF LIFES
TURNING
MY FUTURE INSIDE OUT

NEED TO BE THE KING OF MY REIGN
A LAND OF HOPE, DISASTER AND ANGER

VALUES THAT MEAN NOTHING TO ME
I'M TEARING UP A WORLD YOU CALL PERFECT

BREEDING
A NEW WAY OF LIFES
TURNING
MY FUTURE INSIDE OUT

FUCK YOU PIG, I DON'T WANNA BE YOUR MARTYR
FACE TO FACE, THERE THINGS YOU GOTTA KNOW
PIECE BY PIECE, I HAVE

LEFT YOUR BODY BLEEDING
I BELIEVE, CAUSE I'M DRAWING MY OWN FAULTS

PASSIVE SOULS WON'T TAKE ANY RISK
I WON'T SHOW SUBMISSION TO PRESENT

POSITIVE, I MADE MY BEST CHOICE
I CAN FEEL THE STRENGHT OF REBORN

BREEDING
A NEW WAY OF LIFES
TURNING
MY FUTURE INSIDE OUT

10. Impersonal World
A SUPRAMENTAL
STAGE OF LIFE
I LAUGH AT YOUR VIRTUES
AS I GET HIGHER 
A FLOOD OF SILENCE
MY WORLD BECOMES
SO PERFECT, REAL
IMPERSONAL
IMPERSONAL WORLD

FLOAT IN THE AIR
MY INSTANT LASTS
I USE TO BE ASHES
AND NOW I'M FIRE
I SHRED YOUR LIMITS
I CLIMB YOUR WALLS
I'M RUNNING SINCE
I LEARNT TO WALK
IMPERSONAL WORLD

OF GOOD AND EVIL
I AM BEYOND
AND OLD MAN TAUGHT ME
CAUSE I AM DUE
TO SMASH YOUR KNEES
IMPERSONAL WORLD

11. Sudamerican Porno
I CORRUPTED
MY OWN SONS
YOUR AMBITION
MADE ME ALIVE

YOU DON'T WANT
BUT MAN, YOU ARE INSIDE
AS YOUR KNOW ME
CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE
A NARCOTHIC WAY
TO LIVE YOUR LIFE
PORNO MINDS
ARE CRAWLING IN THE SOUTH

I SEDUCE WITH CHARM
I ABUSE WITH FUN
I COULD BE SO COULD
I'M SO BIZARRE

A DEEP FAITH
FLOWS IN ME
I'M A CHURCH
WHERE SIN LIVES

YOU DON'T WANT
BUT MAN, YOU ARE INSIDE
AS YOUR KNOW ME
CAN'T HELP FALLING IN LOVE
A NARCOTHIC WAY
TO LIVE YOUR LIFE
PORNO MINDS
ARE CRAWLING IN THE SOUTH

UTOPIAS DIE
PEOPLE DIE
I DON'T REALLY GIVE A FUCK
CAUSE I'M ALIVE
AND I'LL ALWAYS BE ALIVE

12. Nailed
THERE'S A NAIL THAT PERMIATES
MY EARS TO REACH THE BRAIN
TAKE IT OUT OF ME NOW
CAUSE THERE ARE WORDS I'LL NEVER
SHARE

TURNS GOSSIP TO IDEAS
WITH A FACE DISGUISED OF TRUTH
NOT TO SEE ANY MIRROR
AFRAID OF NOT FINDING YOU
TAKE IT OUT OF ME NOW

CAN'T YOU SEE THE FEAR
YOU ARE SEEDING IN THEIR MINDS
A LORD DELIVERS PLEASURES
TO THE NEUTRAL, EMPTY MINDS
KEEP ASKING MYSELF
WHAT LIES BEHIND YOUR MISTERIES
YOU SAY YOU ARE CLOSE TO GOD
AND YOUR GOD TO ME

DOESN'T REALLY EXIST
TAKE IT OUT OF ME NOW

13. Nutritive Soul
YOU ARE BEING FED JUST TO LAST IN LIFE
ASPIRATIONS ARE NULE
NO EXPECTATIONS TO GET HIGHER
DECADENCE IN BLOOM

VEGETABLE, CAMEL, LION, CHILD
FIRST ONE IS YOUR LEVEL
ABORTIVE, SEDUCTIVE CHOICE
YOU'RE PRERRATIONAL AMOEBA 

JUST FEED ME!

I'M THE GENERATION
YET TO COME
I'M SUPERIOR PRODUCT
CAN'T HELP YOU TO SURVIVE

JUST FEED ME!

AREN'T YOU TIRED OF BEING NOTHING?
YOUR THOUGHT ARE NEVER INTENSE
BASIC IS YOUR SANITY
IMMUNE TO INTELLIGENCE

JUST FEED ME!

JUST FEED ME
CAUSE I CAN'T LIVE

1. African Tour
Fake, fag!
Nodding upon a mirror
You call your son
It's time enough
Straight ahead
Lies a miracle
Before your eyes
It's a miracle!
Your time has come
It's physical
And carves with strength
Your heart of stone
And you
What's said
Heart of stone
It's a miracle
It's no way,
I've gone nowhere
What's this ancient nowhere?
It's no way,
I've gone nowhere
What's this?
I don't know
Take me!
Got to be a part
Take me!
Got to be apart

2. Fire To Burn
Set myself to ignition
Multitudes of fictions
Sorted the bones to build my cross
And cast spells one by one
We are the ones
For whom the traps
Never worked
Crashed into madness
We want this fire to burn
We take it back to nowhere
Swirl back to nowhere
And raise some prisons for you
Join barbarians
Babylon waits
Blood in your veins
Deep inside
We know we are right
And loved it to be there
We want this fire to burn
We take it back to nowhere
Swirl back to nowhere
And raise some prisons for you
Reborn
Set myself to ignition
Shiny sparks of friction
Satan's born my Satan
This madness once more strikes

3. Domino Fall
Gotta be stronger
Gotta be taller
No showing off
I saw it all
Armageddon
Domino fall
Come on!
Living on the sun
Come on!
Living on the sun
Come on!
Living on the sun
Come on!
Living on the sun
Pampa awaken
Pulse
Shake
Waste
Rise
Waste away
Straight ahead
Pushed to show
My stronger face
Come on!. Living on the sun
Come on!. Living on the sun
Come on!. Living on the sun
Come on!. Living from the sun

4. Manhunt
When i was truly gonna plan demise
What a hand what a fuck pulled back
This times don't seem to fit me
So we must fly there
I squeeze myself
To turn my nerves off
Displayed my chest
To let the bullets flow
Died every day
In someone else's cross
So we can fly there
So now feel i know
So now feel like glow

5. 6 Fingers
I guess the times of the brilliance
Have passed by
Mourned with chastity
I guess the times
Get never enough
I've taken rest from boredom
And as I'm here mysanthropia
Is just legs upon the streets
But goddamn it
I gotta bleed all the way
My fellas goodbye
Never forgive
Never forget the hollow
I left behind all the troubles
I never had
Shared lobotomy
You love like that
Forget is fundamental
But goddamn it
I gotta bleed all the way

6. Taste Of The Prey
How many times everyday
How long do i have to say
Fool
Your heart is bleeding for nothing
It's time to preach
Shine for me
How many times i will die
It's time to resist
Don't stop me now
It's time to resist
Just drag me down
Squeezed to my heart
I hate those martyrs that
Laugh
That claim to be free
And now you feel it more
Than tomorrow
I never listen then
I never learn
It's time to resist
Don't stop me now
It's time to resist
Just drag me down
Squeezed to my heart
I know what
You do in the brain
I know what
You do in my pulse

7. In Blood We Trust
It's just a piece of your guts
It's just sweat in yours palms
Shut up!. It's time
Weapons in hand
So come on do it on your own
So come on do it for us all
Just fucking cows in the Pampas
That's all we are
In blood we trust
I said
Just fucking cows
It's just a piece of your thoughts
It's just to do without doubts
Rise up!. It's time
Weapons in hand
In blood we trust
I said just fucking cows

8. Mercenario
What the fuck are you thinking about now?
And what the fuck makes you think it will
Turn me out?
I'm rebel enough, i never give up
There's everybody
Running to get hook in mouth
Vivir mil años
Revolutions
Made from tears of blood run
Where fat fishes fish
There's everybody in conflict
Would swear they are free

9. Rebelion Inca
Go back, go back
Where the present
Is still not born
Go now, see the light
And it won't turn off at all
I waste my time
But now
My time's gone
Lay in a row
It's feels so warm
And now it's said
To plan rebelion
You lonesome
Your love song
It's said so
And no more
I waste my time
But now, but now
It's gone

10. Absolute
I go for a minute of action
I hope to be a way to reaction
I gotta take the chance
I gotta take revenge
And it never felt
So goddamn right
Gotta let go!
Body moving!
Gotta be in shape
Body moving!
Gotta be fit
It's been a hard surrender
Hope to see you again
And it seems
So far to be so close
It's out there...
It's out there
To refuse

11. Tomorrow
Last time surrendered
Last time had
All that you needed
But had to give up
To that you don't know
But had to give up
When it truly began
But it's know
The time to you dream
You are free
I know i want it to
And know you want to kill
And going down
I like the feeling today
It's another fake, dark waters
Pray tomorrow, pray tomorrow
To set you free
Fuck tomorrow!. Fat tomorrows
That set you free!. I want it now!
You want it now
Revolution again
Set you free
That's it!. Running
Away from me
Running again
Like flash
Running away
Forever

12. Zonda
Strikes divine
A time
Ahead waits
My zonda burns
And far
Ignites from sky
The earth quakes
Pray i pray
For not to be away
I pray, i pray
For nunca mas
I'm blowing
The wind
Just to let
You flow
I'm blowing
The wind
Just to burn
Just to let
You flow
It's time
To say goodbye
To the filth
Stop
Living a lie
I'm gonna
Let you burn
I gonna
Blow and blow i know
I'm gonna
Let you burn
I gonna
Blow and blow i know
