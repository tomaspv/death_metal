1. Immortal Rites
[Music: Azagthoth]
[Lyrics: Vincent]

Gathered for a sacred rite
Subconscious minds allied
Call upon immortals
Call upon the oldest one to intercede
Rid us of our human waste
Cleanse our earthly lives
Make us one with darkness
Enlighten us to your ways

From churning worlds of mindlessness
Come screams unheard before
Haunting voices fill the room
Their source remaining undefined
Shadows cast from faceless beings
Lost for centuries

Lords of death, I summon you
Reside within our brains
Cast your spells upon our lives
So that we may receive
The gift of immortality
Bestowed on those who seek you

[Solo: Brunelle]

(I pray(?))

Repeat 1st verse
Repeat 3rd verse

[Solo: Azagthoth]

(Now immortal)

2. Suffocation
[Music: Vincent, Azagthoth]
[lyrics: Vincent]

Laugh at the tragedies
Mock with disrespect
Goats under rule of father time
Leaches pass judgement on their fellow kind
And die when their inner self goes astray
Alas, I pay homage to the ancient ones
Speak my name!!
Raise the staff of the morbid priest
Descend into the fires of the true law

[Chorus:]
Suffocating evil smoke arise
Cleansing the masses of iniquity
Cauldrons blaze in sanctifying ritual
Vile crematory burns my eyes

Mortals filled with despair
They quest to forsee their fate
Caverns below await the wine to flow
Rape the harvest of souls
I watch in awe as the crucifiers march
Killing time, killing all I see
Another moon rise, human waste
Screaming 'Why hath thou forsaken me ?'

[Chorus]

[Solo: Azagthoth]

[X2:]
It's the dawn of the crucifiers
Suffocation

[Chorus]

[Solo: Brunelle]
[Solo: Azagthoth]

3. Visions From The Dark Side
[Music: Azagthoth, Vincent]
[Lyrics: Vincent]

Dark eyes, shadows grim
They come for me
Midnight chimes, blackened earth
The evils rise
Pits of hate open wide
Chasm of my dreams
Last of chimes - minks arrive
And take my mind again

Waste polluted memories
Acid rivers flow
Vigil for this land's decay
Sounding from below
Dogs of war, satan's own
Plotting all their sins
Weapons aimed at liberty
My vision - no one wins

[Chorus:]
Take my mind
All the way
The darkside calls
I shan't resist

[Solo: Brunelle]

Men forever rot in pain
Mind machines control
Toxic rains scouring brains
Victimizing souls
Winds of war suffocate
Voodoo in the sky
Breathe the gases, breathe no more
My vision - all will die

[Chorus]

[Solo: Azagthoth]

Cut myself and release the blood
Pains of a thousand years
Pathic sights - jorney's end
Descent into another world
My time has come to meet me
Masters... all the corporate lourds
I'm not afraid to face all their
Trials - slavery - in the end they'll
Still have no power over me

[Solo: Brunelle]

Daylight shines blind my eyes
Waken to another day
Tribulation now has passed
But the dreams remain
Walls of sleep fade away
Abandonment of wonders
Monks of knowledge bid farewell
And leave me with these visions
From the darkside

(Visions - from the darkside)

4. Maze Of Torment
[Music: Azagthoth]
[Lyrics: Vincent]

Life betrayal - a warping rage
Evil ripping caverns through your mind
Immolation - in blood you've signed your soul away
Sickening life ends but the horror has just begun
Vultures moaning a funeral dirge
Walls await to cradle you and rip your soul apart
Incessant screams echoes through the maze
Insanity approaches - imminent demise

Maze of torment...[X3]
(Maze of death)

Stricken from the holy book - deliverance to pain
Effigy of jesus christ burning in your mind
Voices cry out to bid you welcome
Locked within the dungeons of darkness - no escape!!

[Solo: Azagthoth]

Passing through corridors embedded with
Scars of those who have gone before you
And left their marks

Warning comes too late to save you now
Visions of suffering stab from the inside

You pray for death
Mourning does no good as you can only die once

Souls are being raped by the maze
Lost in these halls... endlessly

[Solo: Brunelle]
[Solo: Azagthoth]

Maze of torment...[X3]
(Maze of death)

5. Lord Of All Fevers And Plague
[Solo: Azagthoth]

Ninnghizhidda - open my eyes
Ninnghizhidda - hear my cries
Plumed serpent of the deep
Plumed serpent of the gate
I command - come before me
I command - bring the key
Rise from the depths
See the fire in my wand

Ia iak sakkakh iak sakkakth
Ia shaxul

[Solo: Azagthoth]

I call forth the god pazuzu
I call forth the lord of plague
I am of the lost
Creatures of spawn of hate
Rejoice in the heaving earth
Praise the ripping sky
Rise spread disease
Consume their puny souls

Ia iak sakkakh iak sakkakth
Ia shaxul
Ia kingu ia cthulu ia azbul
Ia azabua

[Solo: Brunelle]

Ride the wings of death... [X3]
(Ride the wings of...)

[Solo: Azagthoth]
[Solo: Brunelle]
[Solo: Azagthoth]

[Repeat 1st verse]

[long Chorus]

6. Chapel Of Ghouls
[Music: Azagthoth]
[Lyrics: Azagthoth, Browning]

Ghouls attack the church
Crush the holy priest
Turning the cross towards hell
Writhe in [sings "with"] satan's flames

Crush the priest
The feeble church

[Solo: Brunelle]

Dead - your god is dead
Fools - your god is dead
Useless prayers of lies
Behold satan's rise

Crush the priest
The feeble church
The family of dog
Lust upon my altar

[Solo: Azagthoth]
[Solo: Brunelle]

Demons attack with hate
Satan in the fires of hell awaits
Death against you all
God hear my death call

[long Chorus]

[Solo: Brunelle]

7. Bleed For The Devil
[Music & Lyrics: Azagthoth]

Come to me, lord of filth
Hear my cries princes of nightmares
Touch us with your morbid lips
Let us taste your foulness

[Chorus:]
Bleed for the devil
Impious mortal lives
Feel the enticing power
Fill the chasm of your soul

Fill the air with the smell of death
Grace us with your magic
Fill the night with the stench of evil
I summon forth the beast

[Solo: Brunelle]

[Chorus]

[Solo: Azagthoth, Brunelle]

Cold look in his eyes
He holds the gleaming knife
Girl cries as he cuts way the
Strips of flesh

[Solo: Brunelle]

[Chorus]

[Solo: Azagthoth]

8. Damnation
[Music: Azagthoth, Vincent]
[Lyrics: Vincent]

[Solo: Azagthoth]

Evil Minds grievous sins
Pagan lives have no place for law
Twisted worship exhume the dead
Minds unite for evil cause
Death corrodes the book once strong
Evil lourd destroys his foes
Plague has spread throughout the land
Revelations have begun

Call of evil's mastermind
Christians flock to the beast
Burning crosses burn souls
Exterminate the altar of laws
Atrocities of a new reich
Holy war and holocaust
God weeps and turns his back
The time is right to destroy the world

[Chorus:]
Damnation
Fill the world with plague
Force of devastation
Tyranny from above

[Solo: Brunelle]

[Chorus]

[Solo: Brunelle]

Churning of cities lust so profane
Driving the will to destroy
Crippling powers I'm forced to partake unholy rituals
Crimes of a world barely alive
Melting debauchery
Ashes to ashes, so must I be
Lost in this misery
There's nothing left here for me
I know of no other way
Even death cannot change my ways
I'm first in the line
To hell we shall go

[Solo: Brunelle]

[Solo: Azagthoth]

Call of evil's mastermind
Christians flock to the beast
Burning crosses burn souls
The time is right to destroy the world

[Solo: Azagthoth]

[Chorus]

9. Blasphemy
[Music & Lyrics : Azagthoth]

I am the god of gods
Master of the art
I desecrate the chaste
Writhe in the flesh

Blasphemy

Chant the blasphemy
Mockery of the messiah
We curse the holy ghost
Enslaver of the weak
God of lies and greed
God of hypocrisy
We laugh at your bastard child
No god shall come before me

[Chorus:]
Blaspheme the ghost [X3]
Blasphemy of the holy ghost

[Solo: Brunelle]

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
Rebel against the church
Drink from the chalice of blasphemy
Rise up against the enslaver

(Blasphemy)

[Repeat 2nd verse and chorus]

[Solo: Azagthoth]

[Repeat 2nd chorus]

(Blasphemy)

10. Evil Spells
[Music & Lyrics: Azagthoth]

[Solo: Azagthoth]

Caught within my evil spell
Now it's time to burn in hell
You were fooled on return
You're just a doll for him to burn
See the reaper in his eyes
Messenger - prince of flies
Brain washed with sin and death
Time to burn - my evil wrath

Evil spells...[X2]

[Solo: Azagthoth]

Bring the children down to burn
Once you fall - no return
Sin takes you by surprise
On this backwards hellbound ride
Gates of hell drawing near
Satan loves the taste of fear
Quenching all with black desire
Burn your souls in furnace fire

Evil spells...[X2]

[Solo: Brunelle]

Evil spell of the dead
Messengers of your death
Falling endless in your tomb
Locked within infernal doom
See the reaper in my eyes
Messenger - prince of flies
Warlock's voice surrounds your dreams
Baking soul within your screams

Evil spells...[X2]

[Solo: Brunelle]

1. The Invocation / Chapel Of Ghouls
[Re-released on Altars Of Madness CD]

[Music: Azagthoth]
[Lyrics: Azagthoth, Browning]

[The Invocation]

Ia Ia lord of the waters Iaksakak lord of the waters I summon thee
Come forth and make the gate appear
Iaksakak is the gate in which the spheres meet
Open wide the gate
The ancient ones ruled us all and shall rule again
Come forth through the gate and take the earth as your own

I am the god of all gods
I am the lord of darkness and the master of magicians
I am the power and the knowledge
I am before all things
I am before all gods
I am before all days
I am before all men and the legends of him
I am the ancient one
No man may seek my resting place
I am the god of gods
I am before all things

[Chapel Of Ghouls]

Ghouls attack the church
Crush the holy priest
Turning the cross towards hell
Blind with Satan's flame

Crush the priest
The feeble church

Dead - your god is dead
Fools - your god is dead
Useless prayers of lies
Behold Satan's arise

Crush the priest
The feeble church
The family of dog
Lust upon my altar

Demons attack with hate
Satan in hell he awaits
Death against you all
God hear my death call

2. Unholy Blasphemies
[Re-released on Blessed Are The Sick CD with different lyrics]

[Lyrics - Azagthoth/Vincent; Music - Azagthoth]

Rise through the gate, Iak Sakkath
From depths beyond the sky
The realm of evil gods
Painful... They eat your mind

Laugh in the face of dog
Spread disease upon his church

Ghouls who pray the death of god
Destroy the Catholic church
Vomiting upon the cross
And burn the book of lies

Laugh in the face of dog
Spread disease upon his church
Vomiting upon the cross
Scream forth blasphemy

Yog Sothoth, Azagthoth
Come forth and taste the blood
Infant entrails
Are hung upon the twisted cross

Laugh in the face of dog
Spread disease upon his church
Vomiting upon the cross
Scream forth blasphemy

3. Angel Of Disease
[Re-released on Covenant CD]

Your plastic souls melt within cauldron's burning bright
Chanting to the Ancient Ones, chants of broken lines
Kneel before the altar, sacrifice is made
It is pleasing to the ones most ancient of the days

They call the prince of disease, messenger of the Absu
Carry through icy winds our curse upon their church

Hanging helpless above the pentagram
Sacrifice swings within the leather noose
Sing the ancient hymn that makes the Absu roll
Raise the rusty knife and let loose the blood of Kingu

Sudden death throws off the balance that's within the sky
Priest calls forth infernal names to the ones beyond the gate

Angel of disease one who shuns the light
Shub Niggurath goat with a thousand young

Praise the beast, the chanting grew
Praise the beast with virgin blood
Praise the beast with soul and mind
Praise the beast and do the sign

Bind their kings in iron chains
Execute the judgement for them
Come and taste the earthly pleasures
Orgies of endless time

Beneath the rolling fog hate ignites their minds
From their graves the dead will rise to answer Nammtar's call
Upon a twisted cross the virgin corpse hangs
They blacken out the sun and burn the elder gods

Priests of chaos calling forth
Abominations of the pit
Cthulhu meets in the void
Ancient Ones rule once more

4. Azagthoth
[Re-released on Blessed Are The Sick CD as "The Ancient Ones" with different lyrics]

[Lyrics & Music - Azagthoth]

Locked beyond the gate
Lost within the stars
Realm of Azagthoth
Mocking God
Against the light
Power of the skies
Hateful spawn "We are the chasm depths"

Come forth Azagthoth, Yog Sothoth
Rise, greet the curse with your wrath
My enemies are yours
Twist their minds with your spells
Crush their souls
With infernal grasp

I destroy jehova
In sacrifice
Cauldron burns and receives
Crush the priest of the dark
Raise the horns in blasphemy

Come forth Azagthoth, Yog Sothoth
Rise, greet the curse with your wrath
My enemies are yours
Twist their minds with your spells
Crush their souls
With infernal grasp

Come forth Azagthoth, Yog Sothoth
Rise, greet the curse with your wrath
My enemies are yours
Twist their minds with your spells
Crush their souls
With infernal grasp

[Solo]

Come forth Azagthoth, Yog Sothoth
Rise, greet the curse with your wrath
My enemies are yours
Twist their minds with your spells
Crush their souls
With infernal grasp

I destroy jehova
In sacrifice
Cauldron burns and receives
Crush the priest of the dark
Raise the horns in blasphemy

Come forth Azagthoth, Yog Sothoth
Rise, greet the curse with your wrath
My enemies are yours
Twist their minds with your spells
Crush their souls
With infernal grasp

5. The Gate / Lord Of All Fevers
[Re-released on Altars Of Madness CD as "Lord Of Fevers and Plague"]

[Music & Lyrics: Azagthoth]

Ninnghizhidda - open my eyes
Ninnghizhidda - hear my cries
Plumed serpent of the deep
Plumed serpent of the gate
I command - come before me
I command - bring the key
Rise from the depths
See the fire of my wand

Ia iak sakkakh iak sakkakth
Ia shaxul

I call forth the god pazuzu
I call forth the lord of plagues
I am of the lost
Creature spawn of hate
Rejoice the heaving earth
Praise the ripping sky
Rise spread disease
Consume their puny souls

Ia iak sakkakh iak sakkakth
Ia shaxul
Ia kingu ia cthulu ia azbul
Ia azabua

Ride the wings of death... [3x]

[Repeat 1st verse]

[Chorus]

6. Hell Spawn
[Re-released on Formulas Fatal To The Flesh CD as "Hellspawn : The Rebirth"]

Satan master you are the one
I am of you I am your son
You took all my light
I've given no fight
Turn me to black
Possessed to attack

I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn

You are all I need
For you I bleed
Plant your seed
Demons to feed
Blacken my soul
Under control
Born of fire
I shall return

I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn

Die

Blacken my eyes
You I defy
For you I lie
Master I will die
Born of fire
I shall return
Taken my soul
Under control

I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn

Satan master you are the one
I am of you I am your son
You took all my light
I've given no fight
Turn me to black
Possessed to attack

I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
I am the Hellspawn
Hellspawn
Hellspawn

7. Abominations
[Re-released on Blessed Are The Sick CD]

[Lyrics & Music - Azagthoth]

Churning sea of Absu
Place of weeping death
Tiamat, dark serpent
Lord of the morbid priests
Enraged with hate for god
The priests of chaos chant
From the book of the worm
They burn the symbols of christ

We spit on the virgin lamb
And mock the words he spoke
His ways not worthy of me
We choose to burn in the pits of hell

Wreakers of death and havoc
Inflicting never ending pain
Sing the words of emptiness
Formulas of death
Call the queens of death
And the god of the dead
The sea of Absu rolls
Rising spirit of Nar-Marratuk!!!

Bow down before the master
And pray the defeat of God Dog
Prayer of the ensnarers
Blind fiends of chaos rule

Rise up o powers of the sea
In the name of Absu I call
Come and carry my curse
To the ones who cause me disgust
May they burn in my cauldron
For they are as molten wax
Burn consume thy powers
IA ADU EN I

Liars in wait, priests of the night
Make images to burn by the moon
Robbing the spirit, breaking god's law
Send up our hate to burn heavens gate

[Repeat 1:st verse]
[Repeat 4:th verse]
[Repeat 5:th verse]
[Repeat 6:th verse]

8. Demon Seed
Fear the reaper, twisted lies.
Fear the reaper you will die.
Demon Seed evil feeds.
Demon Seed virgin bleeds.
We crush jehova's church,
Where we hang the priest.

Burn the cross blasphemy.
Burn the cross jehova bleeds.
Demon Seed evil feeds.
Demon Seed jehova bleeds.

We crush jehova's church,
Where we hang the priest.

Fear the reaper, twisted lies.
Fear the reaper you will die.
Demon Seed evil feeds.
Demon Seed virgin bleeds.

We crush jehova's church,
Where we hang the priest.

9. Welcome To Hell
[Re-released on Altars Of Madness CD as "Evil Spells"]

[Music & Lyrics: Azagthoth]

Caught within my evil spell
Now it's time to burn in hell
You were fooled on return
You're just a doll for him to burn
See the reaper in his eyes
Messenger - prince of flies
Brain washed with sin and death
Time to burn - my evil wrath

Welcome To Hell...[2x]

Bring the children down to burn
Once you fall - no return
Sin takes you by surprise
On this backwards hellbound ride
Gates of hell drawing near
Satan loves the taste of fear
Quenching all with black desire
Burn your souls in furnace fire

Welcome To Hell...[2x]

Evil spells of the dead
Messengers of your death
Falling endless in your tomb
Locked within infernal doom
See the reaper in my eyes
Messenger - prince of flies
Warlock's voice surrounds your dreams
Baking soul within your screams

Welcome To Hell...[2x]

Break the gate, devastate
Drag the ball and chain
Metal beast is rising
Come to take his reign
Messengers of evil in the blackened skies
Come child take my hand
Meet the Prince of Lies

3. Fall From Grace
[Lyrics - Vincent; Music - Azagthoth]

Hot wind burns me
Burning as I fall
Cast away
Speechless in the holy way
I survive
The scourge and banishing
To scorching land
I am lord, I take command

(Fall from grace)

Forgive me not
This knowledge makes me strong
To resurrect
The cities of the damned
All the treasures of Sodom
Now belong to me - celebrate
Fallen angels take my hand

(Fall from grace)

Whores long for my flesh
And my desire
Lust anointing me now
Consume my soul

A call to take your hand
For I'm at one with the dark
How dare you come with me
And again you must die

So ancient curse known to me
Behold the powers I unleash
Upon your throne
Know my words, feel my hate descend

Misery
Thorns to lance your every word

Now I crown you king in pain

To plague and moan
So many years my seed condemned
No free to soar!!!

Will is yours? So, creator
No intend could shadow

Blessed are we to taste
This life of sin

My touch is inhumane
Nocturnal beast inside
Is void of light
And empty shall remain

7. World Of Shit (The Promised Land)
Bred from the bowels
Sheep one and all
Bound by the doctrine of lies
To fucked human shit, I shout blasphemy!
As I make my way thru to
The promised land

Smell of shit is so foul
Writhe in disgust
Earth heaves and death comes to call
All the waste - Cling to your lie
You are as sand and the wind blows
My disgust - A fever
To kill a thousand more

Gene dead from birth
God's holy fuck
Canonized but of no use to me
Human shit, untermensch waste begone from my earth!

Desolation - No life bodies littering
Beast of earth devour!
Cleanse this world for those who deserve

Burning cities, all is well
I remain in my conviction
As the waste in sewer flows thru the promised land

8. Angel Of Disease
Your plastic souls melt within cauldron's burning black
Chanting to the Ancient Ones, chants of broken lines
Kneel before the alter, sacrifice is made
It is pleasing to the ones most ancient of the days

They call the prince of disease, messenger of the Absu

Carry through the icy winds our curse upon their church

Hanging helpless above the pentagram
Sacrifice swings within leather noose

Raise the rusty knife, let loose the blood of Kingu

Sudden death throws off the balance that's within the sky
Priest calls forth infernal names to the ones beyond the gate

Angel of disease one who shuns the light
Shub Niggurath goat with one thousand young

Praise the beast, the chanting grew
Praise the beast with virgin blood
Praise the beast with soul and mind
Praise the beast and show the sign

Bind their kings in iron chains
Execute the judgement for them
Come and taste the fleshy pleasures
Orgies of endless time

Beneath the rolling for hate ignites their eyes
From their graves the dead rise to answer Nammtar's call
On a twisted cross the virgin corpse hangs
They blacken out the sun and burn the elder gods

Morbid priest calling forth
Abominations of the sky

Kutulu meets in the void
Ancient Ones rule once more

9. God Of Emptiness
Lies, and you fill their souls
With all oppressions of this world,
And all the glory you'll receive?
So, what makes you supreme?
Lies, and your crown is falling.
I offer fantasy, and you
Create the blind with envy.

Let the children come to me
Their mother loves me, so shall they
Woman, bleeding, ate my gifts
Man was close behind
Just like a snake I'm slithering
Through my world divine
And like the cat I'm stalking
I'll take your soul and you'll be like me
In emptiness, free

Just bow to me faithfully
Bow to me splendidly

10. Dominate
[Music: Azagthoth, Lyrics: Vincent]

Weak aside - no place for those our struggle
Leaves behind
Our Lord won't tolerate those whom through
Attrition fall

We must dominate!

With iron through our veins and a will made so elite
Hunting for our daily bread and the sinister close in sight
Hunger always drives the beast and the women fall prey.

Leading all the wonders to certain fate

Another victim reviled
I'm staring at you through the eyes of the wolf
Tell me who is going to save you now!

Animal senses ever alert
Praise be to the father-war
As a servant I am serving myself and I bathe in anticipation
Unless you taste it you could never know
All the power our Lord bestows
With a bow and a kiss profane
Be a victor or be a victim.

11. Where The Slime Live
[Music: Azagthoth, Lyrics: Vincent]

Where the slime live
(They are the lowest forms of life)
Where the slime breed
(They make a new one too corrupted)
When the wind blows
(The winds of truth are blowing now)
And the cradle falls.... down

Their poison fingers that wrote the poison lines
Their poison lingers
What a tragedy when their fingers are removed

Where the slime live

Their burning dogma
Introducing to our mind - lies
They plot for the total control of the morals
And what a tragedy when the "god-heads" are removed.

They crawl, they breed, they hide but we see
They burn
I see the smoke of the funerals rising
God lives in their heads now laid to rest

What a sight
As their kingdom comes tumbling down
We burn - the ones with contrite souls be gone!

Long gone are the filthy liars
Long gone are their filthy lies
I know they'll come again some day
Where the slime live and how the slime gets washed away

12. Caesar's Palace
[Music: Azagthoth, lyrics: Vincent]

Just close your eyes... can you remember
The generations not so long ago
I feel the shameless urge that we must restore
Our former king to his rightful throne
And with me lords and maidens
We wait for the chosen son's return

I come alive
It's a time for celebration
Our will to restore
Make our past become the future once more

Still he lives! 2000 years have passed
And still we're yearning for his return
We fulfill a wishful prophecy

And so the chanting begins
Hail Caesar... Hail Caesar... we render unto you
What is still yours

Share the wish as it must be
Our king and palace... mode it be!
Gods enslaved, traitors burning
Might and splendor forever return

13. Inquisition (Burn With Me)
[Music: Azagthoth, Lyrics: Vincent]

Come burning... are you going to burn with me?
Won't you come burning?.. the world is watching
All the king's men riding hard
All their horses foaming
And if they were to catch us we'd be set ablaze

Burn!

Won't you come burning... all the dissident ones
Come and walk the line and you will burn with me
Witches yes, slaves never... and still I speak
A heretic amongst you... don't you let me live too long

Burn!

Could you imagine the pain
Why would my country men let me down
They're bearing withess

just to save their skin
That this might keep them from burning
They'd sell their mothers just to save their skin
That this might keep them alive

The marks I'm bearing are oh so deep
My will ingrained at birth
To flood true darkness with light and reverse
You'll see my covenant to keep

Your judgment in the hands of the most inept
Condemn those similar to burn with me
But the night is still young... I'm also feeling very bold
I think I'll do some burning of my own

14. Umulamahri
Why should we serve that which betrays
Leeches, they steal of our lives
Why should we lower ourselves to the beasts
Submissive they are to be made
We need not to be held in their chains
Illusions but they can still hold
We rise within the strength
The One Who lays them to waste

Praising the Weapon that Cleanses our land
So perfect It's Way unopposed
Punisher of the treacherous ones

Umulamahri

This Force no bolt withstands
For It's now the Merciless One
Un-quenchable rage in holds
Only sated when the last falls
Their deeds of treason

Unsees by the ones enchained

Ignorance which shielded the crimes
All seen by the All Knowing One

You'll perish within the Hands
Of the Storm that means your end
These things you call your gods
These things, they save you not

Oh now you live the torment
Bound in the chains that enslaved us
Now you feel the suffering
That you bestowed upon your being

Live the pain of the Gnashing Teeth that's
Grinding your bones enslaver
By what right did you bind us
Now you'll reap the suffering

Oh there's no mercy for you've
Broken the Sacred Laws you've
Taken the dreams of many
Lives you have bound and punished

For your crimes no repentance
Can turn back the Wrath
Which you've called on yourselves
By your deeds

No new life can arise
From a land once denounced
By my Lord
For unrivaled He stands

For no man may rise up
To enslave any other
Made free by Design of our God

That of Might shall
Define what is right
For unmatched is the Power
Of Chthhulhu

Most High

Praising the Weapon that Cleanses our land
So perfect It's Way unopposed
These things you praise as gods
These things, dispirited things

16. Summoning Redemption
[Lyrics - Tucker, Music - Azagthoth]

I stand before thee, gods of all prestine

Come forth to see, all things to be seen
Now know the presence, and choose thy wrath
For flock of tyrants, who know not thy path

Come now in sweeping vengeance
Come now in needed time
I demand as I stand before you
Cleanse this worlds decay

I demand to know the light of a promised land
I demand to see this corrosion wiped away

And the slithering begins
as the shell of men crawl weeping
and as the light of dawn is growing
the realization sets in
And with the winds that are blowing
the final truth has come
That the ways of the shallow empty
have brought it down
The winds that are blowing
shall bring it down

And while your clinging
to the ways of your worthless life
Your words is falling
you are left with nothing
and with the winds that are blowing
the final truth has come
your ways so shallow and empty
have brought it down
your ignorant haze
has brought it down

Return these days to the righteous
heal these wounds of time
I have waited so long
for the winds of change to come
through eyes still clear
through eyes not dulled by fear
through eyes behind the soul
I see what must be...

I demand to know the light of a promised land
I demand to see this corruption wiped away

17. He Who Sleeps
[Lyrics - Tucker, Music - Tucker]

Awaken my brothers,
of vengeance we rise
to divulge this enemy,
to enlighten the ones who sleep

Worlds have passed and so too has time
my slumber now disturbed,
this place of hate, thy worlds shall burn

Humans, I shall feast upon your ignorance.

you will destroy yourselves
Mortals, your slithering existence
sickens the gods, my brothers
it awoke me, from timeless sleep
my dreams destroyed, my visions lost
and so I watch you pray,
and spite your worlds

Forgive me father? I am not your god
you crawl to me, and beg to me my sheep,

you have fallen, curse your empty lives
blind, like wolves you turn on yourselves

18. Enshrined By Grace
[Music - Azagthoth, Lyrics - Tucker]

Depredate, Restraint is not an option
This world has fallen, Now scorched and barren

The rage of lunatics, shall lead us nevermore
The hand, long forgotten, shall feed the blessed now

Arise our Golem Defeat this enemy
God strength upon the leach infested
Rise our ancient wisdom and bring your pestilence

Rectify, With haste your wrath awakened
Malfeasance, You scorn this world
Enshrined by grace, your shadow blinds the feeble
Disentail the noble few

Arise our ancient Golem Defeat this enemy
God strength upon the leach infested
Rise our ancient wisdom destroy this wasteland
Enshrined by Grace devour this presceance

Light the flame of redemption
