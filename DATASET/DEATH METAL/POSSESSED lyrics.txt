1. Introduction
[Instrumental]

2. The Heretic
[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

It is thy heritage to rule the world
Sent to defile from Belial
Revelation unorthodox
Atheistic is so mystic

Fall to the abyss of Hell
Only the weak will not rebel
The prophecies that I will tell
Will make you give your soul to sell

Tie the knots with Satan's twine
Necronomicon will be mine
To be immortal, desires of sin
You secretly hold within

Rule the world with an iron fist
Heavens above will not exist
So foolish is your exorcist
So don't deny my heretic

3. Tribulation
[Music - LL Lyrics - JB]

Can you hear the thunder?
Can you hear the sound?
Can you hear the nightmares
That rise beneath the ground?

You can feel the sorrow
And you can feel the pain
Know there's no tomorrow
You'll never love again

The skies are filled with blood
The sun no longer rises
But no one understood

The final tribulation
The Heavens take their fall
Experience Hell's sensation
Satan standing tall

War between the powers
Fury in the skies
Heaven fights the dragon
With evil in its eyes

Tribulation
In love with Satan
Desecration
Come to Salem

Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
The power of darkness is waiting inside
As the Heavens fall down
Hell will survive
The serpent of death devours your life

4. March To Die
[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

Marching to Death's bell
Descending into Hell
Judgement Day is near
And your fate is clear

March to die, die, die, die

Take my mind and soul
Countless heads will roll
Future lies with me
Come forth, and you will see

March to die
Blackened is the sky
Is it Heaven or Hell?
Only time will tell

Pendulum will swing
Manifesting screams
Oppression will prevail
Lower the window's veil

March to die, die, die, die

5. Phantasm
[Music - LL Lyrics - JB]

Welcome to your funeral
Your life has just begun
Lie in the hearse
Into the morgue
Where the dead unite as one

Into the shrine you fall
Hear the dead, they call
Angel of the damned
Walks with me, hand in hand

Fly through the night which has no end
Into the land where you're condemned
Messiah from the grave
Lead the corpse from hell
Behold the morbid saint
Come forth from whence you fell

As you walk through the valley of death
Phantasia waits for your last breath
The demons stride with the Devil's bride
Rest in peace

Phantom, spread your wings
As the black coven sings
Eyes which mesmerize
From the crypts they rise

6. No Will To Live
[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

Mutants from the battle
Survivors of the blast
Lightning fills the sky
Today will be the last

Blood stains on the earth
As the night emits its shadow
No hope of rebirth
From the final battle

No will to live, so set me free
From this pain and misery

There's no days to pass
No tomorrow here
Next breath is your last
And no time for fear

Death is in the air
And thunder in the skies
Children in despair
By his blade you die

Wear a robe of death
Stand around the fire
Steaming is your breath
Worshipping the sire

Satan's call is strong
From a world away
Tempt you with his eyes
And you will decay

No will to live, so set me free
From this pain and misery

Blood runs from my throat
Razor in my hand
Ended with a slice
All the blood is nice

Hanging by a rope
Wrapped around my neck
End my life with death
Murder on my breath

Drink the blood from my chalice
Come to Hell, and my palace
Grab your heart
It's in my hand
Take you to the evil land

Alone at night
In your grave
Coffin's door is your slave
Blackened earth is all around
Below I hear a burning sound

What could it be except for Hell?
Burning souls is what I smell

Can't suffice
So pay the price
Give your soul
Take the toll
Die

Bleed for me
Your death, so sweet
Die for me
You'll feel the heat
I am real as the earth
Can you feel Satan's birth?

In the night, the undead roam
In the day, you're dead in your home
You can live only by death
Worship Satan with the rest

Burning bodies fall from the sky
Horrid glances in their eyes
Glowing numbers on their heads
They're arrived, the living dead

7. Beyond The Gates
[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

I bow to the altar
For I bow to my faith
Guide me to my destiny
With everlasting grace

Unholy are my thoughts
In you I must confide
I prowl among the nights
With Satan at my side

Bow to the altar
The pagan one
Pray for the birth
Of Belial's son

Beyond the gates

Lucifer, hear me
I pray to the altar
I hear the sounds of insanity
Master, I drink the unholy water
Save me the torment that beckons for me

Walk through illusions of terror to come
And I could tell you of things I have done
I saw the gates
The future I've grasped
I've been beyond Gates of the past

Unearth the graves of all mankind
Beyond dead and buried
Enter the shrine
Condemned to the torture
The horror and pain
Enslaved by your sins
Brought under death's reign

Lucifer, see me
I live for the night
Stalking and prowling in the moonlight
I crave the unholy temple below
Spreading the tales of death that I know

8. The Beasts Of The Apocalypse
[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

Overshadowed is the earth
As the beast does spread its wings
Arrives the Dragon's birth
To rule with the seven kings
Descending from the sky
Ascending from the sea
All Holiness deprived
By the beasts of prophecy

Apostles tell visions of Hell
Dreams of pain drive them insane

Powers of the wicked one
Come forth from the nethermost Hells
Eclipsing the burning sun
Revelation tolls its bells

Heaven's rule will cease
Just as the prophets saw
Prophecies and blasphemies
Are ruled by Satan's law
Seven years, grim and dark
Man will wear the Devil's mark
Nightmares are reality
Symbolic of your destiny

Apostles tell visions of Hell
Dreams of pain drive them insane

9. Seance
[Music - LL Lyrics - JB]

Join hands to summon up the dead
Hear them singing inside your head

Oh, my gypsy, can you tell
If sweet Satan
Will rise from Hell?

Crystal ball, hypnotize
Look inside those demon eyes

Paint the circle around the pentagram
Cut the throat of the crying ram

10. Restless Dead
[Music - MT Lyrics - JB]

Premature burial
Of my soul
Corpses lie in the grave
Their flesh is cold

Emerge the dead
From the grave
Morbid laughter
Afterlife betrayed

Covet the flesh of life
The human parasite
To drink your blood
Sustain their reign
Rise the restless dead

11. Dog Fight
[Instrumental]

* single: "Abandoned" (2018) *
******************************

1. Abandoned (Demo Version)
Armageddon
The darkest evil this way comes
Slaves to heaven
Beating heart, the demon's drum

Satan's legions
Rising up from the pits of hell
Soulless seasons
Revelation tolls the bell

We are abandoned
Banished evil priests
Summoned and branded
Spreading our disease

Deserted and forsaken
Left behind in the world alone
The fire will awaken
Until the prince of the night
Will take me home
Blood and crucifixion
And in this holy hell I stand alone

Abandoned
Abandoned
Abandoned
Abandoned

[Guitar solo: Creamer]

Abandoned
Abandoned
Abandoned
Abandoned

This is the end for you
This is the black room
Where you can go and die
The ancient ones have come for you
Where angels never fly
In the sanctums of the wormâ€™s embrace
And his counterfeit kingdom of sin

[Guitar solo: Gonzalez]

Non-believer
No belief in this world
Or the world to come
Grand deceiver
Abandoned and hated by everyone

Abandoned
Abandoned
Abandoned
Abandoned

1. Chant of Oblivion
[Instrumental]
2. No More Room in Hell
When there's no more room in hell
The dead shall walk this earth
When there's no one left to tell
God dies for Satan's birth
When the churches burn to dust
And the demons rise to kill
When the words all turn to rust
Then hell on Earth is real

When the fire's never quenched
And the worm, it never dies
When gnashing teeth are clenched
And the mouths all fill with lies
When the churches burn to dust
And the demons rise to kill
When the words all turn to rust
Then hell on Earth is real

I'll bring you pain
Fire and hell, forever
Into the flames
Sacrifice together
Down into hell
The night devours the day
To see the chasm burn
I will show the way

Like a plague of hell-born death
That steals upon your brain
Crushing out your last breath
We turn the world insane
Like a legion straight from hell
That quells the Christian soul
Like a witch's blackened spell
All deeds demand their toll

I'll bring you pain
Fire and hell, forever
Into the flames
Sacrifice together
Down into hell
The night devours the day
To see the chasm burn
I will show the way

Storms of chaos
Free my tormented mind
Hell, death and Satan
We are all so blind

Rise from the fire and beg for your life
Bringing you pain that cuts like a knife
Up from below and taking control
Possessing your mind and eating your soul

Demons rising
No more room in hell
Angels crying
No more room in hell

3. Dominion
Pray to your god up above
Bow to your sin down below
All of the kingdoms and the thrones
All of these gifts, yours to own
Gaze in the fire, lose your soul
Swear to the power and behold
Black devils waiting in the night
Blood stains the altar
On this moonlit night

I have dominion over life
I have dominion over death
I have dominion over hell
I have the power of hellfire

Eyes of idols, thrones of man
Built upon the burning sand
All shall perish, fall to ruin
The end of times, impending doom
Seven years and seven lives
Seven brides, the devil's wives
Seven priests and seven sins
Seven gates to enter in

The devil comes and offers all
In return the cities fall
All the kingdoms and all the thrones
All these things are yours to own
Bow before me, on your knees
Close your mind to all the screams
It's your time to enter hell
Bear witness now to all who fell

Pray to your god up above
Bow to your sin down below
All of the kingdoms and the thrones
All of these gifts, yours to own

I have dominion over life
I have dominion over death
I have dominion over hell
I have the power of hellfire

4. Damned
There's a hole in my soul
And a dark in my heart
Think I'm losing my mind
There's a pain in my brain
And I feel I could kill
You are all fucking blind
All my days waste away
And my nights are all fights
So hollow, my soul
I'm alone with no home
Asking why I can't die
Think I'm losing control

I hate the world of men
Of sickening greed and sin
A devil at black mass
Who prays behind stained glass

It's the thrill of the kill
And the speed that I need
When I push in the blade
Wear my sin like a skin
I'm a beast come unleashed
As my world starts to fade
I'm a slave to the grave
I have death in my breath
And I'm falling apart
Slake my thirst for the worst
Hang your hope on a rope
I have death in my heart

I hate the world of men
Of sickening greed and sin
A devil at black mass
Who prays behind stained glass

For what do we suffer?
Why do we live?
If not for our torments
We've nothing to give

No hope for the future
No hope for the past
Nothing is forever
Nothing ever lasts
Nothing to offer
And nothing to take
Except for the falseness
And life that we fake

There's a hole in my soul
And a dark in my heart
Think I'm losing my mind
There's a pain in my brain
And I feel I could kill
You are all fucking blind
All my days waste away
And my nights are all fights
So hollow my soul
I'm alone with no home
Asking why I can't die
Think I'm losing control

I hate the world of men
Of sickening greed and sin
A devil at black mass
Who prays behind stained glass
Where God is never home
And angels left alone
Where dreams have come to die
And we've long stopped asking why

5. Demon
Dark messiah
Black Madonna
Bestow your blessing
Within this circle of protection
Descend archangels
Into the shadows
Behold this coven
Tonight, the nightmares are so real

Praise the demon that dwells within my soul
Hail the evil, releasing pain and fire
Reign supreme and his wisdom's to behold
Satan's cathedral, his temple of desire
The low will rise up, commanding man and beast
The world's inferior who live life on their knees
With plague and famine, from hell there comes a priest
Inside the mirror, the eye in our eye sees

Cast your souls into the fire
Gaze upon the mighty demon
Terror turns to desire
Stars above, below the burning pyre

Praise the demon that dwells within my soul
Hail the evil, releasing pain and fire
Reign supreme and his wisdom's to behold
Satan's cathedral, his temple of desire
The low will rise up, commanding man and beast
The world's inferior who live life on their knees
With plague and famine, from hell, there comes a priest
Inside the mirror, the eye in our eye sees

Cast your souls into the fire
Gaze upon the mighty demon
Terror turns to desire
Stars above, below the burning pyre

Drink blood, destroying all the churches
While laughing at the fire
Kill, kill, slaughter all the clergy
Watch the flames burning higher
Burn, burn, burn the fucking world
And cry, humanity lost
Thereâ€™s no hope, nothing left to live for
Tyrants of the Pentecost
Humanity died while choking on its blood
There's no God, nothing here to save you
The christian churches' tyrannical song
While dead religion enslaves you
Fall, fall, down on your knees
Pray to the air up above
No one cares about your disease
I will bow to no God

Dark messiah
Black Madonna
Bestow your blessing
Within this circle of protection
Descend archangels
Into the shadows
Behold this coven
Tonight, the nightmares are so real

7. Shadowcult
Deep obsession, mind control
Possession of the human soul
Here we gather on this night
Shadowcult, candlelight
Death is certain, life is not
And in the end we all shall rot
Sadistic demons, sacrifice
Shadowcult, candle lights

Give your mind and soul to me
Kneel and I will make you see
Fire will sanctify the earth
Blood announces my rebirth
Tonight the Shadowcult is born
Bound and forever sworn
Souls are mine to take and give
Submit and I will let you live

No salvation of this Earth
We're condemned from our birth
Clouded judgment blinded eyes
Shadowcult will free your mind

Who can open up your eyes
And finally show us paradise?
The cult of the shadows hypnotize
Control your minds and mesmerize
Who's the father of our lies?
Sell your soul, free your mind
Bow your heads and testify
A golden calf to idolize
Who can truly make us wise?
A leader we will canonize
Finally make us civilized
Indoctrinate and humanize
A Shadowcult will wash your mind
Clear your head and compromise
Those opposed we terrorize
Crush their bones and brutalize

Shadowcult
Demon nights
Shadowcult
Demon nights

My thoughts withheld, a mindless hell
My words become an empty shell
My world controlled, as I behold
The master's grip, possess my soul

[Guitar solo: Gonzalez]
[Guitar solo: Creamer]

Give your mind and soul to me
Kneel and I will make you see
Fire will sanctify the earth
Blood announces my rebirth
Tonight the Shadowcult is born
Bound and forever sworn
Souls are mine to take and give
Submit and I will let you live

Born as slaves, free as men
Our salvation comes through sin
Kings and nations, revelations
Fire and torment and damnations

Deep obsession, mind control
Possession of the human soul
Here we gather on this night
Shadowcult, candlelight
Death is certain life is not
And in the end we all shall rot
Sadistic demons, sacrifice
Shadowcult, candle lights

Shadowcult
Demon nights
Shadowcult
Demon nights

8. Omen
Rising up from the depths of the sea
Bringing armies to war
Cast down from the heavens above
Laying waste from the shore

My hell is real
The morning star
My mark is sealed
Triple sixes in scars

Behold, the seven archons returned
Days of vengeance and wrath
Cast down to the cities that burn
Armageddon my path
The beast is creeping through the darkness that comes
While the clarions sound
Seven heads with a whore on its back
The truth of darkness is found

The claw will slash
The tooth will rend
The searing ash
Foul cursed wind

Lord of demons and a thousand years
Satan's legions are near
Break the chains from the bottomless pit
Abaddon's chasm appears
The time, it passes like the future of man
Still, we're doomed to our past
The demon's number just like grains in the sand
The dragon's army amassed

My hell is real
My hell is blood
My hell is here
My hell is good

Eyes of fire, hearts of stone
Praise the end of Christendom
The end of days, eternal night
Blinded eyes devoid of sight
Eternal fire and misery
Diabolic demon screams
Satan sits upon his throne
Cathedrals burn, the fall of Rome
Temples of the burning sand
With evils from the heart of man
Sweeping planets from the sky
His time has come, the beast will rise

Our world has fallen to ruin
Sin and despair
Our god has left us alone
Never to care
I call upon the old gods
Bring us to hell
The second coming of the false prophet
Our Lucifer
Hail Lucifer
An omen of the times foretold
The gods of old rising up from hell
From hell

God is dead, mythology
Lucifer's technology
Put to sleep while still awake
Everything you're told is fake
All you hear and all you see
Disappearing instantly
Satan lives, God is dead
Demonic voices in my head

Broken hearts of sinners and fools
The martyrs burning below
From Golgotha's flowing rivers of blood
We all reap what we sow
I am dead yet forever endure
Engulfed in fire and flames
My life is seeded by an evil so pure
Satan's calling your name

My wicked life
Has brought me here
I bring you hate
I bring you near

Omen [8x]

9. Ritual
Lucifer spreads his wings
Satan's choir begins to sing
Dead will rise to witness hell
Revelation tolls the bell
In brilliant lights the tyrants play
Endless night, the end of days
Blood-soaked altars of sacrifice
For those unnamed in the book of life

This place of desolation
And incantations
The nightmare never ends
In our immortal world of sin
The deathless flame that burns
The all-consuming worm
And from this golden age of hell
I cast my immortal spell

Angels' wings ripped from their backs
Cast down to hell in demon packs
Screams of torment from the damned
Hell and fire consume the land
Where nothing's born and nothing dies
And nothing speaks that doesn't lie
Where nothing's felt that isn't hate
We are the damned, it is our fate

This place of desolation
And incantations
The nightmare never ends
In our immortal world of sin
The deathless flame that burns
The all-consuming worm
And from this golden age of hell
I cast my immortal spell

Cast down from the sky
Made low from on high
Dark devil in my mind
The blinded lead the blind
Such darkness to behold
The ritual unfolds
What gods made this place?
Death to the human race

Lucifer spreads his wings
Satan's choir begins to sing
The dead will rise to witness hell
Revelation tolls the bell
From brilliant lights, the tyrants play
To endless night, the end of days
Blood-soaked altars of sacrifice
For those unnamed in the book of life

This place of desolation
And incantations
The nightmare never ends
In our immortal world of sin
The deathless flame that burns
The all-consuming worm
And from this golden age of hell
I cast my immortal spell

10. The Word
Countless horrors inside my head
Secrets of my mind
The hidden truths if left unsaid
Would leave us deaf and blind
In the dead of night, the spirit comes
To creep into my soul
Through pain, want, desire and need
And then by sheer control
So few desires that I feel
But still I'm left with want
The fantasies, sickening dreams
That always come to
Question all my truths denied
And crawl into my soul
The knowledge sought and gained tonight
Demands a heavy toll

Wisdoms that are paid in blood
The secrets of mankind
Through sacrifice and destiny
But we're still left behind
It seems the end will never come
We suffer every day
And those that came before us prove
It's always been this way

Our world is a lie
The word does not exist
Chaos and oblivion
Our way of life

Wisdoms that are paid in blood
The secrets of mankind
Through sacrifice and destiny
But we're still left behind
It seems the end will never come
We suffer every day
And those that came before us prove
It's always been this way

Countless horrors inside my head
Secrets of my mind
The hidden truths if left unsaid
Would leave us deaf and blind
In the dead of night, the spirit comes
To creep into my soul
Through pain and want, desire and need
And then by sheer control
So few desires that I feel
But still I'm left with want
The fantasies sickening dreams
That always come
To question all my truths denied
And crawl into my soul
The knowledge sought and gained tonight
Demands a heavy toll

11. Graven
Six, six, six on the head and the wrist
The bloodied, battered crucifix
Two coins to cross the river Styx
On bended knees and Satan's fist

Lucidity, tranquility
My lust is forged of centuries
My wars evolve, my slaves defy
And beg for life until they die
In fire, in hell, in death you're mine
The hourglass, the clock unwinds
The time is short to do your best
And every word takes one more breath

Six, six, six on the head and the hand
Flesh and blood and born of man

A graven idol upon its cross
Fall to your knees and cry for loss
Endowed with pain, this mastery
Etched in dust and fantasy
An angel born from heaven's hell
A beast that pounds the bloody nail
Into the void where chaos reigns
Satanic evil, all insane

The blade that splits my tongue
The serpent's sacred sun
The fire that burns so cold
The words I speak are old

All alone now, my heart, it breaks
Dead inside, as I pass through the gates

Six, six, six on the head and the wrist
The bloodied, battered crucifix
Two coins to cross the river Styx
On bended knees and Satan's fist

Lucidity tranquility
My lust is forged of centuries
My wars evolve, my slaves defy
And beg for life until they die
In fire, in hell, in death you're mine
The hourglass, the clock unwinds
The time is short to do your best
And every word takes one more breath

The blade that splits my tongue
The serpent's sacred sun
The fire that burns so cold
The words I speak are old
