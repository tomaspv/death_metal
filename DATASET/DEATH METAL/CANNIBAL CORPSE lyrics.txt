*****************************************

1. Hammer Smashed Face
There's something inside me
It's, it's coming out
I feel like killing you
Let loose of the anger, held back too long
My blood runs cold

Through my anatomy, dwells another being
Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding
Brutality now becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge's my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead

Eyes bulging from their sockets
With every swing of my mallet
I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in
through the cracks, blood does leak
distorted beauty, catastrophe
Steaming slop, splattered all over me

Lifeless body, slouching dead
Lecherous abcess, where you once had a head

Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust
You will never live again, soon your life will end
I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face
facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half

Crushing, cranial, contents

Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes
Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised
Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon
Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions

Suffer, and then you die
Torture, pulverized

At one with my sixth sense, I feel free
To kill as I please, no one can stop me

Created to kill, the carnage continues
Violently reshaping human facial tissue

Brutality becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge's my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead

2. I Cum Blood
Swollen with liquid
Ready to burst
A load of my lymph
Will quench this dead body's thirst
One month in the grave
twisted and half decayed
She turned a putrid yellow
I pissed in her maggot filled asshole

Fucking the rotting
My semen is bleeding
The smell of decay
Seeps from her genital cavity

The smell was unbearable
As I unburied her
I cum blood from my erection
I feel it run
down her throat, swallow
Eyes glassy and vacant
body dug up to play with
Skin greasy and naked
tounguing her rotted anus

I need a live woman
to fill with my fluid
A delicate girl, to mutilate, fuck and kill
her body exceptional
she thought I was normal
but I wanted more

I came blood inside of her
chocking on the clot
gagging on the snot
gushing blood, from her mouth
bloody gel leaking out
Body buried in a shallow grave
Unmarked for none to find
The sickness I have left behind
Undetected go my crimes
The greatest thrill of my life
To slit my own cock with a knife

Violent, climax
Serging serum
on my skin

Back from the dead
I am resurrected
to spew, putrefaction

3. Addicted To Vaginal Skin
[Speech intro:]
I don't know
I just took that knife
And I cut her from her neck
Down to anus
And I cut out the vagina
And I ate it

A relapse of my body
Sends my mind into multiple seizures
Psychologically a new human being
One that has never been

Cursed by the shamen
his voodoo spell has my soul
My limbs
go numb
I can't control my own thought
Are his now
his evil consuming me
ever telling me
begin the clit carving

Slowly turning me, into a flesh eating zombie
Knowing this spell can only be broken
by the vaginal skins of young women
I proceed to find the meat
their bleeding cunts will set me free
I can't control my own thought
I can't control my own thoughts
Warmth seeping from this
Body
Rotted
After I sucked the blood from her ass

I feel more alive
more alive than I've ever been
Even though now I'm dead within

My mouth drools
As I slice your perinium
My body smeared
With the guts I've extracted
through her hole, came swollen organs
cunnilingus with the mutilated

My spirit returned from the dead
Released by the priest
but I felt more real
when I was dead

The curse is broken
I have a dependence on vaginal skin
It's become my sexual addiction
I must slit, the twitching clit
Rotted cavity hold the juice

Between the legs, I love to carve
My cock is dripping with her blood

4. Split Wide Open
Melting thoughts of disintegration
Hitting deep her insistance
to mutilate her newborn infants
After giving birth her mind wasn't the same
Slowly slipping away, a state of mental decay
Family now complete
Father watches on
As mother dismembers
her newborn son

Dissecting the specimen, split
I will explore, the body wide open
Uncover carnage within, split wide open
Virgin, untouched skin
Releasing her rage
That dwells inside
tainted blood rushes through veins
her body chemically changed
Love was erased, on the edge of a butcher's knife

The kitchen becomes a makeshift slaughterhouse
every nine months she butchers one more child
Reminders of the deceased, scattered through the home

Bones and skulls of sons and daughters
Genitals ferment
In jars inside the cupboards
for father to dissect
No one will discover the murder they commit

Children used like laboratory rats
Sickening vulgar experiments
She sees what others can't
Probing the guts of her fetus
Advocation of the pain
Mutilating, draining veins

Witness the horror
offering to themselves
Continuing murdering their own kind
Never deny this fantasy life, they enjoy
Addiction to this heightened state
Post-birth psychosis
disjointing her own children
form the life they'll never live
A massacre within her soul
Struggling for control

5. Necropedophile
I was once a man before I transformed
into this molester, freshly deceased children
You have born, torn by my rape
The dead are not safe, the lifeless child corpse
I will violate

Pleasure from the dead, complete satisfaction
I open the coffin
Sick thoughts run through my head as I stare
At the dead, over and over, I can't escape
I begin the dead sex, licking her young, rotted orifice
I cum in her cold cunt, shivering with ecstasy
for nine days straight I do the same
She becomes by dead, decayed child sex slave
her neck I hack, cutting through the back
I use her mouth to eject

Here I cum, blood gushes from
bleeding black blood
her head disconnected
As I came, viciously I cut, through her jugular vein
She's already dead, I masturbate with her severed head
My lubrication, her decomposition
Spending my life molesting dead children

Intercourse with infants
Curing heads on top of spikes
boiling skulls
Skin sliding off of bones

Voices
The voices call
Voices
The voices are calling me
Buried dead I've spiritually infected
Call to me from beyond their graves

Bleed
I now bleed pus
I bleed, the blood of the dead
I bleed on her livid skin
Thrusting myself within
Beginning to chop through her hairless crotch
Beyond what we know as death
It haunts me everyday
I hear the voice of every child
That lies next to me decayed
A fresh corpse, to fill with my infection
Tortured before death, no orifice left unfilled

Violated after death
Virgin hole I infest
Anal pore spewing cess
The sacred juice I injest
Your dead child I defile
Necropedophile

6. The Cryptic Stench
Tearing at my neck my sharpened teeth pierce the meat
My warm bloodied prey sustains my life for one more day
The oldest of souls, left behind after life
Before death I was nothing but human

Indulgence in the blood, intoxicated from its drug
It warms my cold soul

Tapping the gushing sap, trickling down my throat
Rejuvenation of my body
No blood left to scab
Now it flows through my veins
Heaven I have found
Fear in my grip
Transcend beyond mortal
The sweet blood
I will swallow
Draining the inner spirit
Feasting on the power
Knowing only pleasure
Human blood I devour

Ghastly beauty look into my eyes
to reproduce with the living
every century

Impregnation of the virgin
I drink the blood of the unborn
Returning to my grave
dragging my blood drained prey
My body burns from the light
Sleeping until night

In my clutch, you greet me with open arms
soon I will rip them off
And drink the blood from the stumps
Life and death are too clear
but mankind is blind to see
the twisted path of their own mortality

Scripts of the dead
Netherworld knowledge
Rotten fragrance lingers
Unleash the odor
I have risen

Vampire
Zombie
Sucking on
Arteries
body
numbs
One of my sons died for your sins
Resurrect him so I can
drink his blood again

7. Entrails Ripped From A Virgin's Cunt
Alive alone now that they've gone dead but unburied
I've seen it unfold, terrible scenes of agony
Eyes in the darkness
Echoing their madness

The sights that have passed before them
Watching as though it has never happened
Now I only listen to what is not spoken

Murder, hatred
Anger, Savage
Killings I have caused
more than can be counted
orgies of sadism
And sexual perversion
Virgin
Tied to my mattress
Legs spread wide
Ruptured bowel, yanked
From her insides
Devirginized with my knife
Internally bleeding
Vagina, secreting
her blood-wet pussy
I am eating
on her guts I am feeding
Mutilated with a machete
I fucked her dead body
The first and last
Your life's only romance
My knife's jammed in your ass
As you die you orgasm

Pass on to the dead
Nerve trembling convulsions
No longer looking human

I never see them, but I know they're there
Locked in my subconcious
Obscene memories I thought I'd forgotten
Haunting unrealities
Tear at me
Hold her arms
Her mouth taped shut
Screams unheard
Out pour her guts

Layers of flesh peeling away
Languish in your own decay
descriptions of my killings
bone chilling

Terror, tear, her
Virgin cunt

Virgins are my victims
Their tight interiors I explore
Sharpened utensils of torture
Now inserted inside of her
Sex organs extracted for eating
On her liver I am gnawing

Forbidden lust for guts
Ripped from her cunt
Tears of blood cry down her thigh

I ram my fist inside her hole
From her crotch piss now flows
Rectum filled with shit
I fucked her emptied body
Until she became stiff

8. Post Mortal Ejaculation
Suffering my only need now is to hang
the rope does swing, hanging from the darkened ceiling
Strangling, dangling from my twisted spine
I knew I would enjoy death more than life
My lids close tight, but the light blinds my eyes
My body grows cold - my cock becomes erect

Watching over my dead shell, from beyond in my own hell
Caught between life and death, even though my body's dead
I still feel the touch of flesh
Given the choice to die or live dead
Purgatory my damnation
Climaxing at the resurrection
Adipocere spurts from my erection

Manifested in my rotted body
Unpure spirit, dead among mortals
I have risen from self-murder
Only to rot and kill
to break the necks of young women
their cunts my pus will fill
Acid burning through her crotch
I baptise her face with my rot
Then venom foams from her throat
On my discharge she will choke

Pulsation, my heart begins to beat
Heaving, goiters start to secrete
caustic odor, steaming gruel
wallow in my infected drool

Swollen pusing gashes
Start to reek

Puncture wounds in the back
hacked up limbs, bones now crack
Skin fillet from your face
Breasts gounged out
I fuck with your chest

9. Beyond The Cemetery
Nude and violated I raped the life from her body
Lying dead the insects bite her pale skin
My marks of torture
Left on my daughter
Body badly beaten
I remember
My ropes and chains
Bruised her arms and legs
I wiped her blood on my face
Her tender body I disgraced
Slow strangulation

Her neck twisted and broken
Abdominal lacerations
Blood pouring from
Abrasions

Control of the mind
Feelings left behind
Dreaming inner hate
I create an alternate state of the grave
Scared to death
Homicidal premonitions
Horror fills you
As your soul is ripped from you
Dreaming my dream of death
I cast the spell
Intertwine your mind with mine
Dreams become reality
Enhancing the imagination
Murder is my infatuation
Killing off generations

Families torn to pieces
By the one they love
Possessed by another
My pleasure is to murder

Entering your dreams
Through my spell they will bleed
Night after night
Reoccurring killings

Sleep

Someone wake me
From this nightmare
I've become my darkest fear

Awaken to the sight
Of your hacked up family
Their spirits are trapped
Beyond the cemetery

Bodies rotting, but I'm not sleeping
Scream you're not dreaming
Someone wake me
Form this nightmare
I've become my darkest fear
Came to life
In my mind
A world of darkness
Forever sleeping in this coffin
Eternally dreaming...

Forever sleeping in this coffin
Eternally dreaming...

Dreaming...
Dreaming...
Dreaming...
Dreaming...
Eternally...

Dreaming...

1. Devoured By Vermin
[Music: Webster, Barrett]
[Lyrics: Webster]

Ravenous waves attack,
drawn by the scent of life
Fever for our blood

Instinct rules this mass, ruthless living sea
Devouring

Countless vermin gnashing at my face
Tear meat from my skull
Swarming, rabid, features are erased
Unrecognizable
Body covered, rat filled innards
Shred internal organs
Heart and lungs consumed from inside but my
pain doesn't end
I have not died

Devour, cesspool of vermin
Devour, bloodthristy rabid
Devoured by vermin

Resistance now gives way,
the rodents freely feed
Tearing at my skin
Muscles are exposed, shining red with blood
Meat that they seek

Crawling rodents gorging on me
Repulsive starving droves
Shredding, stripping, consuming all I was
Tissue pulled from bones
Dying slowly, feeling every fang
Shock has yet to come
Scavengers tear out my eyes
My pain won't end, I have not died

Devour, cesspool of vermin
Devour, bloodthristy rabid
Devoured by vermin

Ruthless gnawing vermin - feed
Cleaning off my bones while I breathe
Stenching greasy rodents - swarm
My body is losing its form

[Lead - Owen]
[Lead - Barrett]

Devour, cesspool of vermin
Devour, bloodthristy rabid
Devoured by vermin

2. Mummified In Barbed Wire
[Music: Webster]
[Lyrics: Webster]

Wrap the wire round the neck,
pull it tight to suffocate
His mouth is spewing steaming blood
Hang the body with a cord, gag his mouth
with shards of steel
He doesn't know the pain he'll feel
Interwoven deadly spikes, tightening cables
lacerate
Assorted gashes open wide
Ruptured veins are gushing blood, scraps of
skin are flying off
The body of the helpless prey

Jagged cable binds, you scream, No escape
Metal barbs tearing at you, Rend your flesh

Tear apart the tendons,
wire chokes the victim
Shred away his features,
shred away his being
Rip the tissue from the body, Rend your flesh

Lacerate, sharp spikes rip
Mutilate, pierce the skin

Mummified in barbed wire
Breathing stops, life expires
Mummified in barbed wire
Metal binds as you die

Tangled in a web of pain, No escape
Blood seeps through the metal sheath,
Saw-like noose

Tear apart the tendons,
wire chokes the victim
Shred away his features,
shred away his being
Gleaming cords encase the corpse, No escape

Lacerate, sharp spikes rip
Mutilate, pierce the skin

Mummified in barbed wire
Breathing stops, life expires
Mummified in barbed wire
Metal binds as you die

Steel wraps your face, blood soaks the steel
Bound in wire, soon to die, life choked out,
bleed to death

[Lead - Owen]
[Lead - Barrett]

Mummified in barbed wire

3. Perverse Suffering
[Music: Owen]
[Lyrics: Mazurkiewicz]

Lusting for eternal pain
Begging to be tortured
Agony brings relief, I am insane

Indulging in self-mutilation
To satisfy my need again
The pain severe from severed veins
Curing me of deprivation
Pain I crave
Euphoric state of butchery
Revelling in gore and blood
Pain I save
Igniting visions of the past
Dismembered bodies never found
Pain I gave

Deranged by my deviance,
savage goal to maim and kill
Obsessed with my cruelty,
vicious ways for me to die
Sado-masochistic rage, horrific daze, reality
Pleasure from sadistic intent, driven by my
lust for pain

Punishment my way of life,
suffering intensifies
Sacrifice
Brutal frenzy, no control,
perverse actions gratify
Wretched abnormality,
condoning inhumanity
Suicide
Carnivorous abusiveness,
boiling sawn-off testicles

Afflicted fate stricken to malignancy
Lechery dominates my misery

Tortured eternally, torment inside of me
Disturbing impulses, living in agony
Rancid degenerate craving impalement
Demented destiny, not fearing agony

Excruciating hunger that I need to feed
Soon to be slaughtered, dead, maliciously

Tortured eternally, torment inside of me
Disturbing impulses, living in agony
Rancid degenerate craving impalement
Demented destiny, not fearing agony

Deranged by my deviance,
savage goal to maim and kill
Obsessed with my cruelty,
vicious ways for me to die
Sado-masochistic rage, horrific daze, reality
Pleasure from sadistic intent, driven by my
lust for pain

4. Disfigured
[Music: Webster]
[Lyrics: Webster, Fisher]

Repulsion of beauty drove me to hunt
A frenzy of self hate possessing me
Violated their bodies, stripped of their pride
Tortured and twisted until they have died
Hatred inside is all I would find

I despise what I see in the mirror
Sadistic hateful scum
I kill them but it's myself I hate
Now I'll do myself too
A straight razor will reshape my face
First my ears then my nose
Blood is gushing continue to carve
Erase the face I hate
Now I'm hacking at my chest
A frenzy of self hate possessed me
Controls my actions, controls my thoughts
As I scrape away at my skin

I fill my tub, with alcohol
I plunge into the burning pool
The pain intense, my whole body
Is drenched in scalding liquid
Despite my pain I am able
To grab a lighter on the counter
The flint ignites, the flames erupt
I'm consumed in the inferno
Cauterize, my skin is charred
Regenerate, more loathsome than before

I despise what I see in the mirror
Sadistic hateful scum
The abomination before my eyes
A reflection of me
I see an image of disfigured evil
I've skinned myself alive
Dripping with blood and blistered by fire
The face I hate erased

5. Bloodlands
[Music: Webster]
[Lyrics: Webster]

I am lost and sickened
Disoriented by this bleak environment
How I came to be here escapes my memory
This is a desert, deep scarlet grains
Stretch the horizon and the sickly brown sky
Gale force winds pepper my face
The sand tastes foul,
the sand tastes like blood

Savagely cruel, barren expanse, the atmosphere,
a caustic fog
Every breath reminds me of pain
Dust of dried blood filling my lungs
On the horizon I see a chasm, a distant pulse
begins to beat

[Lead - Owen]

Suddenly a flash, specter of the past
Vision of mass murder, torrents of blood

The vision quickly ends,
the wasteland still beckons
Plodding toward the chasm
I hear rushing liquid

My mind cannot conceive,
the massacre I behold
An infinite river of cadavers,
buoyant in their own blood
Vertigo engulfs my brain as
my body fails and drops

[Lead - Barrett]

A million corpses staring
Straining to survive,
limbs flailing in the blood
Grapple with headless bodies
Hands of the dead are pulling me downward
Drowning in this river
Intestines are alive, like tentacles they choke
Situation hopeless
I submit to the fury of the river

Paralyzed with terror
Thousands of their thoughts
are entering my mind
Conscious on their level
Every tortured death is experienced at once
Drowning in their anguish
Ordeal of their deaths now saturates my brain
Vengeful corpses shrieking
Genocide, genocide, genocide, genocide

6. Puncture Wound Massacre
[Music: Webster]
[Lyrics: Webster, Mazurkiewicz, Fisher]

Stab, hack, slash, kill
Stab, hack, slash, kill
Stab, hack, slash, kill
Stab, hack, slash, kill
Die, butcher
Rage of hate
Stab, hack, slash, kill
Stab, hack, slash, kill
Stab, hack, slash, kill
Stab, hack, slash, kill

Kick down the door in barbaric rage
Frantically slashing all who stand in my way
Stab another face, slit another throat
My intention is to mutilate them
People are screaming it feeds my hate
Hack through the crowd blood is splashing on
my face
I only see red, rage exploding
Two knives, one mind, that hate has broken

Stabbing, disfigure, knives puncture
Blood gushing from their wounds
Rivers run deep red
Down faces of people in the room
Bodies are heaping they're dying
In seconds they were slain
Daggers in my hands are killing
This worthless piece of shit

[Lead - Owen]

Hate for them still drives my rage
My job is almost finished only one remains
In the corner terrified behind the
grisly slaughter
I'll take my time on this last scum bag
Knife in stomach, he's not dead yet
Carving up his body, gouge his fucking head
Chop off his arms, pull out his guts
No remorse for what I have done

Stabbing, disfigure, knives puncture
Blood gushing from their wounds
Rivers run deep red
Down faces of people in the room
Daggers in my hands are killing
This worthless pieces of shit

7. Relentless Beating

8. Absolute Hatred
[Music: Barrett]
[Lyrics: Barrett]

Never leave your nest unguarded
Next of kin the first to go
Absolute hatred cast upon the family
Payback for the hated one

I am the judge, jury, executioner
And pallbearer all in one
Process of elimination
Affirmative action has just begun
Expectorate upon your soul
Malicious devilry is unleashed ten fold
You cannot hide

Witness of my stopping power
Reaction time is not enough
Psychological torment tearing at you sanity
it has to be, it must be done

Hatred flows, uncontained, feel my wrath
Through the death of your entire tribe

Hatred flows, uncontained
I must archieve my revenge through hatred

[Lead - Owen]
[Lead - Barrett]

I've regained my pride
Victory's mine
You cannot hide
The footsteps you hear are gonna be mine

9. Eaten From Inside
[Music: Owen]
[Lyrics: Owen]

[Lead - Owen]

Dwelling inside was an anger, an anger that
grew into hatred
Grinding, churning inside of me
Seeking, finding the need to feed
On my soul, it now appears I've lost control
Of my mind, it's now begun to tear and grind
The pain, its destination my brain
Can't hide from being eaten
from inside - inside

Originating deep within, a heart
that is now cold and dead
Tearing its way through my organs,
leaving nothing but shreds
Ripping, tissue is torn away
Severing, parts and veins in the way
My insides are on the outside of me
My bones now shatter and explode
The pain, its destination my brain
Can't hide from beign eaten from inside

[Lead - Owen]

Left on the ground is my head,
waiting for the final blow
Brain violently corroding,
the end won't come fast only slow
Seeing what's left of my body
Drowning, blood is surrounding me
My skull melts revealing my brain
Exploding, my body's imploding
The pain, its destination my brain
I've died, I've been eaten from inside

10. Orgasm Through Torture
[Music: Webster]
[Lyrics: Mazurkiewicz]

Suffer to survive
Instinct I despise

Stalking the night, searching for
A victim to defile
Cock she craves today
Cum she wants to spray
And to reach the orgasm through torture

From behind, pain shivering down my spine
I feel paralyzed only controlling my mind

Strapped to a table, naked, genitals exposed
Eyes claimed open, mouth
gagged shut, terrified
Locks my scrotum in a vice and
tightens forcefully
Agony, silent screams, want to die

Shackled and bound, unaware my fate
Destined to be maimed to stimulate

The skin is peeled off my dick
Done with a razor blade
She begins to suck
Blood and cum amok
She rips my cock off with her teeth
Masticate, gnawing and chewing the stump
She regurgitates, I'm covered in my bloody
chunks

Suffer to survive
Instinct I despise

I am alive, victimized
Tortured fate, asexual state

11. Monolith
[Music: Webster]
[Lyrics: Webster, Mazurkiewicz]

Imminent decay of life
Ruthless, dead monolith
Human race will be devoured
Cannibals

Ghoulish - undead vanguard, silent killers,
striking quickly
Blood lust - for the living, eat their flesh,
drink their blood
Callous - in their method,
murderers, murderers
Horrific infiltration, monolith of undead
Slay the living
Is only object for this
bestial rotting horde
Slaughtering the helpless,
slaughter all that lives
Driven by an evil force, to feed on humankind
Exterminate resistance, exterminate them all
Cunning and yet mindless
stealthfully they kill
Army of decay plodding
toward the breathing ones
Countless decomposing
corpses walk upon the earth
Outnumbering the living,
soon they'll be extinct

Zombies, seek life
Mindless killing all in sight,
addicted to entrails
They crave warm flesh
Hunting, dead seek
Ruthless feeding on the weak,
savagery prevails
Tear them to shreds
Fighting, undead
Flesh wounds bleeding black not red,
invincible undead force
There is no hope
Zombies, devour
Quicken mankind's final hour,
fate will run its course
There is no hope

Walking dead surround,
search for living flesh
Ambush on the town, takes a shocking toll
Screams of living fade as
the dead destroy their lives
They die
Hollowed bodies heap, empty carcasses
Innards are devoured by the mob of ghouls
Remaining living flee the horde

Ghoulish - undead vanguard, silent killers,
striking quickly
Blood lust - for the living,
drink their fresh blood
Callous - in their method
murderers, murderers
Horrific infiltration, monolith

[Lead - Owen]

Imminent decay of life
Cause by this monolith
Human race was sacrificed
Their future does not exist

Armies of undead
Slaying the living
Bestial rotting horde
Monolith of death
Cannibals

1. I Will Kill You
[music, lyrics, vocal patterns: Webster]

Bleed for my pain
Revenge on treacherous snakes
They will pay

Slicing the flesh
Sculptured wounds my catharsis
I will stain

Into the heart
Needle injects gasoline
Convulsions

The one that they betrayed
Has made them this way

Plagued by the bastards
I will kill you
Killed by my rage

Scream at my face
The grisly scars went unavenged
Until now

Deep in the hole
You are not gagged and scream aloud
But unheard

Choke on your vomit
You watch your hands cut off
Then your legs

The one that you betrayed
Will kill you this way

Scarred by the bastards
I will kill you
Killed by my rage
I must kill you

Into the throat
The scalpel slices
Warm blood sprays out
The gushing entices

Pull out your heart
And let you watch
Shove in your mouth
Then stab your crotch

I watch your agony

I am released
From years of pain
Your death averted
My becoming insane
You are dead

I have killed you

2. Disposal Of The Body
[music, lyrics: Webster]
[vocal patterns: Fisher, Webster]

The basement incinerator
Is where they'll put the head
Hose the floor and clean the room
Anywhere they bled

Into boxes go the bags
Fill the space with rocks
In the dark of night
He throws them off the docks

Rotting in the river
Never to be found
Under tons of concrete
Deep beneath the ground

From behind he grabs his mouth
The blade goes to his neck
Bulging veins pumping blood
He struggles to protect

If you don't cut open the stomach
The corpse will rise and float
The victim is discovered dead
Rotting organs bloat

The killer chops the body
With a scalpel and an ax
The parts are then drained
And put into the sacks

Grab the neck, Slit the throat, take the life
Hang the corpse - Prepare to drain the blood

Bone saw, meat cleaver, filleting knife
Carve the corpse - Dissect him in the tub

Smash the teeth, slice off scars, crush the bones
With a crowbar - scrape off all tattoos

If you don't cut open the stomach
The corpse will rise and float
The victim is discovered dead
Rotting organs bloat

The killer chops the body
With a scalpel and an ax
The parts are then drained
And put into the sacks

Chunks of a skull
Sawn in half bones
Body is found
Killer unknown

[Solo - Owen]

3. Sentenced To Burn
[music, lyrics: Webster]
[vocal patterns: Fisher, Webster]

Follow the one
Evil masked in pride
Charisma to lead
Speeches laced with hate

Leading the dense
The bovine human herd
Inherently stupid
The fools deserve this fate

Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black

Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die

Burning the world
And all of it's life
Throwing all the people
In a pit of fire

Watching the sheep
Gathering to die
Followers in life
Follow to the grave

Follow the one
Evil masked in pride
Charisma to lead
Speeches laced with hate

Leading the dense
The bovine human herd
Inherently stupid
The fools deserve this fate

Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black

Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die

Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn

Burning flesh
Miasma of their death
Civilisation
It is destroyed

Pits of corpses
Unholy grave of war
Hanging victims
Guilty of free thought

Warfare begins
Cities are ablaze
Tortured screams
Skin turning black

Carbonization
They will all burn
Mass execution
They will all die

Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn

War of fire shred their souls
Burn in hell doomsday's toll
Failed to see the trap they laid
Demagogues lead them into the flames

[Solo - Owen]

Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn
Pile the bodies
Set them aflame
The human race
Sentenced to burn

4. Blood Drenched Execution
[music: Webster, O'Brien]
[lyrics, vocal patterns: Mazurkiewicz, Fisher]

Blood Drenched Execution
Carnage inspired by hatred and evil
Fatalities the final solution
Feel the fucking pain
I rip your child from your cunt
The fetus is kept alive
To die before caring eyes

Slaves in hell for me
A tortured death will set you free
The executioner
I was meant to be
Born to kill for all eternity

The exsanguination
Savage display of murder and mayhem
Casualities of primal abduction
Red is spraying from
The hole in the baby's head
The slaughter will not subside
This day a family dies

Young blood is so pure
Unborn infant is dead premature
The executioner
Has to mutilate
A fetal pulp is all that remains

Rapid blood loss
Flooding the floor
Gore is unstoppable
Rabid blood lord
Carving the whore
Extremely contemptible
Rancid rancor
Insatiable from my proclivity
Random tirade
Eternal death inevitable

[Solo - O'Brien]

Blood drenched execution
Carnage inspired by hatred and evil
Fatalities the final solution
Felt the fucking pain
I ripped our child from your cunt
The fetus was kept alive
To die before blood soaked eyes

5. Gallery Of Suicide
[music: Webster, O'Brien]
[lyrics: Mazurkiewicz]
[vocal patterns: Mazurkiewicz, Fisher]

Into the abyss, perpetual and torturous
The gallery of suicide, internal torment
Archaic carcasses, displayed degeneracy
Once within these walls a life of death will be unleashed

Forever dying are the dead, countless bleeding heads
Cadavers splattered red from the self-slicing of necks
Stenching maggot filled bodies, skulls and bones rot away
The slaughtered souls that chose to die, enveloped in death

Darkness is the only light, suicide the way
Hideous forms of human death, mounds of flesh slowly decay
Embrace the horrid nature, carnage on display

Pain never felt
Enslaved inside this massive grave
Life, evil fate
Only slaves to death can survive this place
Die, perdition
Penance in putrid decadence
Dead miscreants
Enter the decrepit necropolis

Lurid interment in the hellish abattoir
Impetuosity and horror, after-life is tortured
Entrails, guts, and blood is this museums decor

Blood, impiety
Chastened are the sanguinary
Purge, radical
They perish, the victims of vagary
Vile tragedy
With great vehemence the hapless died
Kill, suicide
Serrated blades assist in destiny

Death opened the gallery
Sarcophagus
Ecstasy in suffering
Imprecation

[Solo - Owen]

Blood, impiety
Chastened are the sanguinary
Purge, radical
They perish, the victims of vagary

6. Dismembered And Molested
[music: Webster, Owen]
[lyrics: Webster]
[vocal patterns: Fisher]

Sever the limbs
Decapitate
Yank out the teeth
Then masturbate
Pounding the face
Ejaculate
My darkest needs
I satiate
Bathe in blood
Wallow in bile
Tear out the heart
Victim defiled

Sever the limbs
Decapitate
Yank out the teeth
Then masturbate
Pounding the face
Ejaculate

Entrails slip through my fingers
As I sift through her innards
My body rigid with goose bumps
My erection growing stronger
I put my cock into the carcass
My climax can wait no longer
Expectorate my seed of hate
Onto her mutilated corpse

Sever the limbs
Decapitate
Yank out the teeth
Then masturbate
Pounding the face
Ejaculate
My darkest needs
I satiate

Bathe in blood
Wallow in bile
Tear out the heart
Victim defiled

7. From Skin To Liquid
[music: Webster, O'Brien]

8. Unite The Dead
[music: Owen, Webster]
[lyrics, vocal patterns: Webster]

Her flesh decaying she rises to see
Lecherous ghouls with rotting erections
Her breasts are lactating blood and pus
An orgy of death, cadavers of lust

Gray skinned bodies pulsate as one
Grasping her flesh, erotic undead
Maggots crawl on their rotting cocks
Into her cunt, rigid like rock

Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate

Breeding the damned
Carcasses writhe
Revel in death

Bleeding and sore
Insatiable corpse
Consummate the bonds of death

Beautiful eyes are now vacant pits
Her body contorts, her vagina has fangs
Putrid fluids will mix in her loins
The seed of the undead will grow inside

Hiding from mankind the embryo grows
Nourished by flesh the mother consumes
After the birth the child will grow
Prince of the dead conceived by profanity

Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate

Gifted with speech
The offspring will lead
Establish their reign

Lusting for flesh
But living, not dead
The corpses will rape
Rape!

Lascivious legions of blasphemous ghouls
Kill to create hoards of their own

Lust of the dead will multiply
Thousands of corpses beginning to rise
Living again for rape and destruction
Ejaculate bile from their erections

Lascivious legions of blasphemous ghouls
Kill to create hoards of their own

[Solo - Owen]

Kingdom of rot the bastard will rule
Stinking of death, zombies will roam
Through the whore the world was crushed
An orgy of death, cadavers of lust

Licentious masses rejoicing in sin
Larva faced sluts fucking the ghouls
The rancid bodies will copulate
Their barren world they repopulate

Fucking the zombie whore
Unite the dead
Fucking the zombie whore
Fornicate

9. Stabbed In The Throat
[music: O'Brien]
[lyrics, vocal patterns: Mazurkiewicz]

As the blood begins to gush out the side of your neck
I thrust my cold steel into your face, your closer to death
A twelwe inch blade will help decide your ultimate fate
This summons to die has been given to you for accepting my hate

Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived

Vocal cords twitching, esophagus severed, a hemorrhaging brain
Your lacerated jugular vein is spurting away
As mortality fades I am ready to flay your whole body and head
Vigorously carving this fresh human flesh, I am one with the dead

Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived

I'm chewing bloody skin from the cadaver
Consuming lifeless meat, mangled and tattered
Half-eaten corpse lies skinless in the gutter
I am revitalized

Odium, embedded in my skull

To kill and eat your prey a way of nature
The taste of death must consciously be savored
My cannibal existence never dangered
Just look into my eyes

Subjugate, intensity to blame

Gnawing on the head, sliced to fucking shreds
Knife to the gullet results in cessation

[Solo - O'Brien]

Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived

10. Chambers Of Blood
[music, lyrics, vocal patterns: Webster]

Deathless sin
Led to the place of atonement
Repent through pain
Slicing off proof of guilt

Immortal lust
Blood craving torturers revel
Pain through penance
You will plead for your scourge

Burnt with iron
Retinas scorched
Eyes are blind
Purge the mind

Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life...bleeding

Walls are stained with blood of vice
Learn through scourge
The errors of depravity

Immortal curse
Inquisitors for eternity
Scourging to learn
The stamina of the condemned

Disembowel
Torn apart
Heaving lungs
Severed tongues

Never to speak evil, never again
This is the way it must be
Burnt at the stake or
Stretched on the rack
Burning your soul
Draw out your guilt

Pieces torn off
Pieces that sinned
Tumors that must be destroyed
Chop off a cock or carve out a cunt
Cleansing your soul, bleed to atone

Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life

Bleed on it's infernal walls
Nailed to the prison you made
Scraps of flesh litter the halls
Torture the price has been paid

Disembowel
Torn apart

Never to speak evil, never again
This is the way it must be
Burnt at the stake or
Stretched on the rack
Burning your soul
Draw out your guilt

Pieces torn off
Pieces that sinned
Tumors that must be destroyed
Chop off a cock or carve out a cunt
Cleansing your soul, bleed to atone

Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life
Bleed on it's infernal walls
Nailed to the prison you made
Scraps of flesh litter the halls
Torture the price has been paid

11. Headless
[music: Webster]
[lyrics: Mazurkiewicz]
[vocal patters: Fisher, Mazurkiewicz]

Drawn to an act of complete domination
Violent urges of decapitation
Premeditated murder, invidious
Soon she will be vanquished, insidious

Headless
Headless
Headless

Abscission of her head is what I'm craving
I will become her homicidal savior

Headless
Headless
Headless
Headless

Tainting of the mind, need to obliterate
Inhumanity, desire to decolate
Utmost frustration or totally insane
Either way, in my hands, I will crush her brain
Tainting of the mind, need to obliterate
Inhumanity, desire to decolate
Utmost frustration or totally insane
Either way, in my hands, I will crush her brain

Preparing for medieval demise
A make-shift guillotine out of burcher knives
I'll watch her body quiver from the chaos
Peel off her face and frantically chew her eyes

She finally enters my dwelling of sin
It'll be done in a matter of minutes
As I embrace her for one last single time
In horror I realize, death is mine

I feel the cold blade pierce the back of my neck
The blood spews incessantly, flooding my face
Convulsions and spasms as life fades away
Ironically, I'm the one with no head

Headless
Headless

12. Every Bone Broken
[music: Owen]
[lyrics, vocal patterns: Mazurkiewicz]

Die, shattered you'll die
Bones broken in half
Blood flowing freely
Limbs severed in hate
Brains splattered, demise
Skin eaten in wrath
Eyes ripped from your head
Lie shattered, you die

For believing you could be free
Weakness only invigorates me
These broken bones once yours, I hold
Cause of death will never unfold

Torn, mangled, and maimed
Life withers away
In hellish decay
Bones shattered, you die

For not seeing things I see
Your pummeled body strengthens me
These broken bones keep me aware
Of how I lust to shred and tear

Every bone broken is my only goal
Sucking the marrow of your fractured femurs
Every bone broken, your truculent toll
Succumbling to my offensive demeanor
Every bone broken enhances my soul
Your twisted corpse is contorted dead rot
Every bone broken, your life I stole
I'll kill again and I'll never get caught

[Solo - O'Brien]

The snapping and cracking of skeletal remains
The pleasure of devouring decomposed flesh
The feeling of power from crushing your skull
The stench of decay overwhelming my brain

I slaughtered your body and returned it to dirt
Not a trace of proof that you ever existed
Pure satisfaction through what I have accomplished
I'll kill again and I'll never get caught

13. Centuries Of Torment
[music, lyrics: Webster]
[vocal patterns: Webster, Fisher]

Generations
Denying penance
Eternal life reborn
Time and time again
Deny
Salvation
I refuse it
I will not be saved
Return to human form
Murder

Heartless
Bestial
I kill
Without
Pity for victims with untrue gods
My instinct will push beyond
Feelings like guilt, remorse or mercy
My flesh holds a soul of

Generations
Denying virtue
Eternal hate reborn
Time and time again
Defy
Redemption
Spit upon it
My soul they cannot claim
Return to kill again
Butcher

Unclean
Spirit
Searching
Hunting
Another life to maim and kill
A beast with brutal will
Lifetimes spent on a quest for blood
And with my death it does not end

Evil reborn for eternity
Centuries of torment

I will not be saved

[Solo - O'Brien]

When I die
They beg me to repent
I refuse

I return
The past forgotten but evil innate
They have lost

They will not be saved
They will die

14. Crushing The Despised
[music: Webster/Owen]
[lyric: Webster]
[vocal patterns: Webster/Fisher]

Screwdriver repeatedly lands in his face
Gouges and hacks at the man of disgrace
Tearing off muscles from the bones of his chest
Rending his flesh with rage I've been blessed

Chopped off the tongue that told the lies
I spit on him and laugh while he dies
Lying there helpless I throw brick at your head
Starving for violence and now I've been fed

His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back

His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
Chopping at his face in hate, I gouge and hack

Crushing the despised

Under my boot I hear your bones crack
So many things that you want to take back
I won't forget and I won't forgive
Not so long as I allow you to live

Chopped off the tongue that told the lies
I spit on him and laugh while he dies
Lying there helpless I throw brick at your head
Starving for violence and now I've been fed

His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back

His blood drips from my mouth
I bit his larynx out
Biting off fingers when he tried to push me back
Chopping at his face in hate, I gouge and hack

Crushing the despised
