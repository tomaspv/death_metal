1. Infernal Death
Piling the bodies
Burn them in the night
Skin grows black and withered
Decayed smell will rise

Existence fading
Into ashes
Burn those bodies
To Infernal death

Human coals are burning
Repulsive yet so true
Open graves are scattered
When the work is through

Existence fading
Into ashes
Burn those bodies
To Infernal death

2. Zombie Ritual
Revengeful corpse out to kill
Smell the stench, your guts will spill
Vomit for a mind, maggots for a cock
With his axe the corpse will chop

Stare into his eyes
Now in his spell
Kiss the rotting flesh
Now you're in hell

Drink from the goblet, the goblet of gore
Taste the zombie's drug, now you want more
Drifting from the living, joining with the dead
Zombie dwelling maggots, now infest your head

Zombie ritual
Zombie ritual

Ceremony now complete
Chosen one is now deceased
Fucking, raping zombie whores
Killing, feasting no remorse

Stare into his eyes
Now in his spell
Kiss the rotting flesh
Now you're in hell

Drink from the goblet, the goblet of gore
Taste the zombie's drug, now you want more
Drifting from the living, joining with the dead
Zombie dwelling maggots, now infest your head

Zombie ritual
Zombie ritual

Zombie ritual
Zombie ritual

3. Denial Of Life
In your dreams
The pain is so real
Before the dead
You'll have to kneel
Hear your future screams
See your epitaph
As you scream
The dead they laugh

Pain, growing stronger
Life, exists no longer
Welcome, to a world of pain
Death and despair

Denial of life (Vile denial)
Denial of life
Denial of life

Created by your mind
To overtake your life
Sacrificial suicide
End it with a knife
Much too late
To change your mind
A bloody corpse
Is left behind

Pain, growing stronger
Life, exists no longer
Welcome, to a world of pain
Death and despair

Denial of life (Vile denial)
Denial of life
Denial of life

4. Sacrificial
With chainsaw in hand
Your death I demand
Slicing through your fat
My awaited gore attack

Manipulating lies
Is your way of life
Riding on cheap glory
Your life is getting gory

Watch you bleed to death
Gasping for last breath
Choking on your blood
I shit onto your guts

Sacrificial cunt
I despise
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies

Slabs of fat
Lay on the ground
Ram an axe
Into your mound

Time to pay the gruesome price
A stupid cunt we sacrifice

Watch you bleed to death
Gasping for last breath
Choking on your blood
I shit onto your guts

Sacrificial cunt
I despise
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies

Sacrificial cunt
I despise
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies

5. Mutilation
Massacred, hacked to death, my revenge
Slicing deep, into your flesh, the pain intense
Dreams of hate, misery, fill my mind
Puke in your face in disgust, it's time to die

You must die in pain
You must die in pain
You must die in pain
You must die in pain

Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation

Staring your severed head in the face
I celebrate a faggot's death, human disgrace
Hanging your mangled corpse for display
My revenge was fulfilled upon this day

You must die in pain
You must die in pain
You must die in pain
You must die in pain

Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation

You must die in pain
You must die in pain
You must die in pain
You must die in pain

Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation

6. Regurgitated Guts
Suicidal preacher hangs himself
Unfaithful servant goes straight to hell
When he returns, your life will end
Down from the skies maggots descend
Least expecting his horrible face
Your decayed guts you soon will taste
Unholy feeling grows deep inside
Choking on your guts you open wide

Regurgitated guts
Satisfy his needs
Regurgitated guts
Now you're gonna bleed

Visions of death are growing clear
Life as a corpse is what you fear
Searching through the graves to be set free
From the curse of the priest that's come to be
So unaware of what's to come
Your guts are his when he is done
Reaching for your cross to end this pain
Your life and blood he will have drained

Regurgitated guts
Satisfy his needs
Regurgitated guts
Now you're gonna bleed

In his trance
Your eyes they bleed
Your guts come forth
For his own need

7. Baptized In Blood
Under command a new-born child
Submerged in blood, the dead they smile
Growing possessed, burning inside
A bloody feast for us tonight

The way of death
Is growing hear just take my hand
Skies grow black
Unholy corpses upon their land

The dead they gather around
Praising the child they found
Possessed, the child shall kill
The future is now revealed

Baptized in blood
Destined to burn
Dark is my soul
Reborn they'll learn

Gather around, watch and see
A new creation of misery
Taking the place of the elderly dead
Forbidden ways now in his head

The way of death
Is growing hear just take my hand
Skies grow black
Unholy corpses upon their land

The dead they gather around
Praising the child they found
Possessed, the child shall kill
The future is now revealed

Baptized in blood
Destined to burn
Dark is my soul
Reborn they'll learn

Baptized in blood
Destined to burn
Dark is my soul
Reborn they'll learn

8. Torn To Pieces
Out to find the truth
Behind the myth of
Man eating man
Finding bodies tied
Up to a stake
You cannot understand
Filled with ignorance
You watch them eat your friends
Ask for evidence
A hook right through your tits

Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces

Trying to escape
They torture you by
Cutting off your cock
When you're dead
They'll feast upon your flesh
Your brains they'll
Eat and chop

Pray if you want
Pathetic rancid cunt
Face reality
Death your final pleasure

Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces

Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces
Torn to pieces

9. Evil Dead
Trapped inside a life which is not yours
Spirits within causing terror, fear and darkness

Evil dead
Evil dead

Voice speaks out, all will die tonight
Insanity fills your mind, you hear them calling

Evil dead
Evil dead

Covered in blood, all hope is lost
Forever to rot, controlled by the powers of the

Evil dead
Evil dead

10. Scream Bloody Gore
Decapitated head licking your cunt
Sucking all the blood from your stump
Intestinal guts taking their hold
Leaving you dead, stiff and cold

Controlling the minds of the bloodthristy dead
Unholy seizure slicing through your head
Who will survive only time will tell
Dripping from your mouth comes a rancid smell
Lobotomised corpse shredding your flesh
Leaving your body a bloody mess

Scream bloody gore
Scream bloody gore

Inject the reborn terror, the blood comes spurting out
Another to control, add it to your count
Orders to destroy, rip and tear apart
Wishing for the end, your dead is just the start

Controlling the minds of the bloodthristy dead
Unholy seizure slicing through your head
Who will survive only time will tell
Dripping from your mouth comes a rancid smell
Lobotomised corpse shredding your flesh
Leaving your body a bloody mess

Scream bloody gore
Scream bloody gore

Armies of the dead
Hail their leader's head
Hungry for the flesh
While it's warm and fresh

Through the smoke who will see
Who will come out alive?
Now it's your turn to feel the pain
Now it's your turn to die

11. Beyond The Unholy Grave
[Bonus Track]Messenger of evil
Haunting your soul
Laying in peace
Taking my corpse

The meeting that was held
Graveyard of death
Trying to resist it
Slow unholy breath

Beyond the unholy grave
Beyond the unholy grave
BEYOND THE UNHOLY GRAVE!

Screaming in silence
Within mystery
Inside is spilled
With your brain

Demeaning it was hell
Graveyard of death
Trying to resist it
Slow unholy breath

Beyond the unholy grave
Beyond the unholy grave
BEYOND THE UNHOLY GRAVE!

Beyond the unholy grave
Beyond the unholy grave
BEYOND THE UNHOLY GRAVE!

12. Land Of No Return
[BONUS TRACK]

Mangled bodies falling from the sky
Grotesque mutation ripping out your eyes
Now a corpses slave you'll learn to rot
A life of endless gore is what you've got

[CHORUS]
Rotting till the end of time
In the land of no return
Here your screams remain unheard
Watch your flesh decay and burn

In this land there is no night or day
In pools of blood, the corpses sit and prey
Unholy carcas begging for relief
Existing everyday in morbid grief

Searching for your soul
Nowhere to be found
Wanting to return
Six feet under ground

[CHORUS]
Rotting till the end of time
In the land of no return
Here your screams remain unheard
Watch your flesh decay and burn

* album: "Spiritual Healing" (1990) *
*************************************

1. Living Monstrosity
Every day blows by in a world of corrupt addiction
With life comes pain withdrawals and deformation
Breaking the mould of human appearance
Contorting bodies with chemical interference

The guilty one, innocent she now cries
A life of hell, better off to die
Born without eyes, hands, and half a brain
Being born addicted to cocaine

Living monstrosity
A freak for life they'll always be
Never knowing love or hate
Only pain the drug creates

[Solos: Murphy, Shuldiner]

Some say she's naive, she's a stupid bitch
Some say to forgive, guilty she should die

The beginning of the end begins at birth
Breeding masses of twisted screaming flesh
An example we should make out of theses creators of misfortune
A serious crime that should not be forgiven

The guilty one, innocent she now cries
A life of hell, better off to die
Born without eyes, hands, and half a brain
Being born addicted to cocaine

2. Altering The Future
Creating a life only to destroy
Saved from a life of the unemployed
Where crime is the only way to survive
Which is the best to be dead or alive?
Maybe a chance but maybe not
Born to be thrown in the trash to rot
To exist in this world might be a mistake
The one who is with child, it's their choice to make

Death and life taken so easily
Right or wrong, whose choice will it be?

Abortion, when it is needed
Execution, for those who deserve it
The giving and taking of life will always be
Altering the future

[Solos: Shuldiner, Murphy]

Look into the future to prepare us for our fate
Controlling our existence with every life we take

Life for a life should remain the rule
The innocent victim that is what's cruel
Look to the past is what we should do
When justice was done and justice was true
Using our laws to help their escape
An easy way out is what they create
Claiming insane is the way to freedom
People are stupid enough to believe them

Death and life taken so easily
Right or wrong, whose choice will it be?

Abortion, when it is needed
Execution, for those who deserve it
The giving and taking of life will always be

3. Defensive Personalities
One mind divided into three, for every problem a personality
Each one trying to protect, for the crisis a person they'll select
With sorrow comes reassurance, with confusion there's ignorance

Deny who they are, a fantasy gone too far

Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive Personalities

[Solos: Shuldiner, Murphy]

Passed down from generations, years of pain and complications
Darkness was a punishment, memories time cannot mend
Brutalized from the day of birth, to reality they can't return

Existing in a world of three lives inside of one

Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive Personalities

4. Within The Mind
Transforming your mind from the inside out
Overcoming fear that made you doubt
Observing what is stored in the subconscious
Trusting what you feel with your gut responses

See past the dark and use your energy
Learn from these images
Thoughts that we call dreams

This power lies within the mind
Gain wisdom through abilities
Change what's to come in future time
Avoiding pain and misery

[Solo: Murphy]

Look through the fake from what is real
Making decisions by what you feel
Live for the future and not the past
The weak of mind will never last

Perceiving from visions that reoccur
Analyze your dreams to gain
A better perspective of your life
In control of your destiny with mind and soul

[Solo: Shuldiner]

See past the dark and use your energy
Learn from these images
Thoughts that we call dreams

This power lies within the mind
Gain wisdom through abilities
Change what's to come in future time
Avoiding pain and misery

5. Spiritual Healing
Always blocking the doors to your mind
Escaping reality that surrounds you
Using faith an excuse to kill
A sick way of life is now revealed

All the prayers in the world can't help you now
A killer a taker of life is what you are

Speak no more lies
It's your turn to die

Preach the good word
Speak no more, prepare to burn
A justified torture?
From this may others learn
The life you took a holy death, a grave mistake
No changing your mind, your life you should pay

Practice what you preach
Your loved one is now deceased
Knowledge is at our hands
Never to understand

Spiritual healing

[Solos: Shuldiner, Murphy]

Blinded by twisted ways you live
Kill for religion, will the Lord forgive?
Idiocy has stricken your mind
A real-life hell you will find

All the prayers in the world can't help you now
A killer a taker of life is what you are

Speak no more lies
It's your turn to die

Preach the good word
Speak no more, prepare to burn
A justified torture?
From this may others learn
The life you took a holy death, a grave mistake
No changing your mind, your life you should pay

6. Low Life
Those who are a waste of life
Use up air that others could breathe
Human leaches all around
Superior is what they believe

Fake is the word you represent
Your existence on earth I resent
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie

Low life - That's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect - That's what you like to see

Hiding behind material values
That help cover up your weakness
Never to change, always to look
For an easy way out of life

[Solos: Murphy, Shuldiner, Murphy, Shuldiner, Murphy, Shuldiner]

A pathetic excuse for a human being

Nothing to back you up, never give a second thought
Thinking you fool the world, into seeing something you are not

Fake is the word you represent
Your existence on earth I resent
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie

Low life - That's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect - That's what you like to see

7. Genetic Reconstruction
Extending a life with total resistance
To fatal disease, future methods of science

Replacing what is real by using technology
Population control, selecting those who will breed
A specific type of form chosen for the unborn
A mind without emotion
Progressive anatomy

Genetic reconstruction
Evolution in production

[Solos: Murphy, Shuldiner]

Producing a race of human machines
A new age of existence the world will see

Replacing what is real by using technology
Population control, selecting those who will breed
A specific type of form chosen for the unborn
A mind without emotion
Progressive anatomy

Genetic reconstruction
Evolution in production

8. Killing Spree
To the world around he was the perfect person
Planning for an alibi he then starts rehearsing
A human bomb just waiting to explode
This secret rage can't be controlled

Slaughtered the dreams of others
One left to recover
Self-inflicted wounds
Life he has consumed

Planning a killing spree
Victim of a conspiracy?

Getting bored with his current life
Rearranging with a knife

[Solos: Murphy, Shuldiner]

Greed before despair suspicion starts to grow
His life was spared for this he does not know
Screams filled the air there was no way to help
The ones he mourns he killed himself

Slaughtered the dreams of others
One left to recover
Self-inflicted wounds
Life he has consumed

Planning a killing spree
Victim of a conspiracy?






****************************
* album: "Symbolic" (1995) *
****************************

1. Symbolic
I don't mean to dwell
But I can't help myself
When I feel the vibe
And taste a memory
Of a time in life
When years seemed to stand still

I close my eyes
And sink within myself
Relive the gift of precious memories
In need of a fix called innocence

When did it begin?
The change to come was undetectable
The open wounds expose the importance of
Our innocence
A high that can never be bought or sold

[Chorus:]
Symbolic acts - so vivid
Yet at the same time
Were invisible

[Solo: Schuldiner / Solo: Koelble]

Savor what you feel and what you see
Things that may not seem important now
But may be tomorrow

Do you remember when
Things seemed so eternal?
Heroes were so real...
Their magic frozen in time
The only way to learn
Is be aware and hold on tight

I close my eyes
And sink within myself
Relive the gift of precious memories
In need of a fix called innocence

When did it begin?
The change to come was undetectable
The open wounds expose the importance of
Our innocence
A high that can never be bought or sold

[Repeat chorus]

2. Zero Tolerance
In the dark of night...
Abusing a portion of light
While others are sleeping
And some are escaping
A serpent spews out fantasy-
Unjustified blasphemy
That cannot be condoned

[Solo: Schuldiner]

It must be strange to not have lived
So far into existence

This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won
Let justice be done

[Chorus:]
There will be zero tolerance
For the creator of hallowed intentions
There will be zero tolerance
Fate is your deciding God

[Solo: Schuldiner / Solo: Koelble]

Karma comes crashing down
Leaving a very deep scar
Exposing a door to the
Source of a verbal whore
Machines supply the altar
Where virtuous lives are sacrificed

[Solo: Koelble]

It must be strange to not have lived
So far into existence

This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won
Let justice be done

3. Empty Words
Ashes and promises share a bond
Through the winds of change
Words are blown away
When visions that should be
Are tattooed in your mind
The power to let go
Is sometimes hard to find

The answer cannot be found
In the writing of others
Or the words of a trained mind
In a precious world of memories
We find ourselves confined

Claws so razor sharp
Ripping at the spirit

[Chorus:]
Promises a potential to hurt
Is anything real?
When forever is to be until
Deep inside, in the world of empty words...
No escaping from those haunting
empty words...

[Solo: Schuldiner]

Do you ever feel it?
A craving that is so strong
To by thought rewind in order to find

Expectations that shined through the doubt
That soon would turn into the price
Of what a word will be worth
When tomorrow comes
To be and we are left
Standing on our own-
And seeing what is real...

The answer cannot be found
In the writing of others
Or the words of a trained mind
In a precious world of memories
We find ourselves confined

Claws so razor sharp
Ripping at the spirit

[Repeat chorus]

4. Sacred Serenity
Wherever we go, whatever we do
Your shadow is not far behind our steps
And our breath
Protecting and watching all...
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you?

Following all instincts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure

[Chorus:]
Sacred is the gift that they
have without knowing
Serenity is knowing it's safe
from destruction of time

[Solo: Schuldiner]

Maybe we could take a step back
And discover what leads us to attack
Time that is short - distance unknown
For them, each day life has just begun
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you?

Following all instincts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure

[Repeat chorus]

5. 1,000 Eyes
Crossing the line into the other side
Emerging as prisoners
To the emptiness of time

To the left and to the right
From behind - they're out of sight
Plunging into a new found
Age of advanced observeillance
A worldwide, foolproof cage

Privacy and intimacy as we know it
Will be a memory
Among many to be passed down
To those who never knew

[Chorus:]
Living in the pupil of 1,000 eyes

Was it overlooked in front of all our faces?
Now, all the mistakes and secrets
Cannot be erased

[Solo: Schuldiner]

Viewing the blind complexity
By which laws were justified
To erase simplicity

To the left and to the right
From behind - they're out of sight
Plunging into a new found
Age of advanced observeillance
A worldwide, foolproof cage

Privacy and intimacy as we know it
Will be a memory
Among many to be passed down
To those who never knew

[Repeat chorus]

We are enslaved now...

6. Without Judgement
Guilty until proven innocent
We condemn your soul and fate
Never mind the possibilities
Too busy for logic or to calculate

Take part in a diminishing breed
Where complex turns to simplicity
When pain is acknowledged
Frivolous calculations will be abolished

[Chorus:]
Without judgement what would we do?
We would be forced to look
At ourselves emerged in lost time
Assuming what may be
Without judgement
Perception would increase a million times

[Solo: Schuldiner]

Distracted by imagination
That experiments with ease
If you could taste it, it might be addictive
Where life will crush those who defy

Take part in a diminishing breed
Where complex turns to simplicity
When pain is acknowledged
Frivolous calculations will be abolished

[Repeat chorus]

7. Crystal Mountain
Built from blind faith
Passed down from self-induced fantasy
Turn a page to justify
Conjuring power - it opens wide
On your seventh day,
is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive
all that you want
To assume from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with your
cross-turned dagger

[Chorus:]
Inside crystal mountain
Evil takes its form
Inside crystal mountain
Commandments are reborn

All the traps are set to confine
All who get in the way of the divine
In sight and in mind of the hypocrite
A slave to the curse forever confined

[Solo: Schuldiner]

Shatter the myth
Don't cut yourself
On your words against
dreams made of steel
Stronger than any faith
That inflicts pain and fear,
is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive
all that you want
To assume from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with your
cross-turned dagger

[Repeat chorus]

8. Misanthrope
From above and around,
Observations are collected
Knowledge is taken in by curious life forms
That may bring hope from beyond
Beneath the giver of life, our sun
An examination of another kind is done

A view from those who stood high
And breathed the sky
An opinion from below and from above

Some were decided, some were not
A few looked away, but none forgot

[Chorus:]
Misanthrope
Hater of all mankind
There is some hope
For those who own their mind
They came, they saw and acknowledged
Some good, some bad
Opinion: dangerous

[Solo: Schuldiner]

Stay where you are, don't get consumed
By what they created from sheer neglect
In denial of years and years of
Shattered souls
That were lost to the power of
Fragile, frightful minds

A view from those who stood high
And breathed the sky
An opinion from below and from above

Some were decided, some were not
A few looked away, but none forgot

[Repeat chorus]

9. Perennial Quest
The journey begins with curiosity
And envolves into soul-felt questions
On the stones that we walk
And choose to make our path
Sometimes never knowing
Other times knowing too much

Filtering out the bad that holds us back...
Take hold of what is true to your hunger
A hunger that will not go away
Plans for tomorrow, they will remain

[Chorus:]
Won't you join me on the perennial quest
Reaching into the dark, retrieving light
Search for answers on the perennial quest
Where dreams are followed, and time is a test

No time for mental crutches
The maker has moved on
I will take it raw and be on my way

Those that stood beside me
I'm glad you understand
Behind these written words
I share the simple plan
To hang on to the way that we feel

[Solo: Koelble / Solo: Schuldiner]

From rivers of sorrow
To oceans deep with hope
I have travelled them
Now, there is no turning back
The limit, the sky
I ask my questions Why? What today?
When tomorrow?

Filtering out the bad that holds us back...
Take hold of what is true to your hunger
A hunger that will not go away
Plans for tomorrow, they will remain

[Repeat chorus]
