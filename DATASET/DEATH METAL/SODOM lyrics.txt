1. Deathlike Silence
A twilight was in my mind
Fulfilled of suspended bare foreboding
Great erhaulted forms of life
Touched me by my nightmare
Feel the inflamed impression in my soul
Appeared that I get blessed

DEATHLIKE SILENCE
DEATHLIKE SILENCE

Trustful eyes look up to me
Bring they harm in my exsist
Terrible things revelated the curse
A petual attemp to blasphemic cruelty
Revelated me to that what I am
I hear it, feel it the weird...

DEATHLIKE SILENCE
DEATHLIKE SILENCE

Grasp the sneep tamed snake
Drink fertite poison without ingure
Men spotless and pure heart
True secret as grave
Master of earth and all on it

No reason to vespair
Ready to fo though hell
Always known the fate
Morbid addication to pain

Talk to me in a prophetic sound
I am choosen to saw the true
That have rage as no earthly calamity
Looking for the centre of labyrinth
But its known in my unconscious mind
Escape to myself coined of envy

DEATHLIKE SILENCE
DEATHLIKE SILENCE

No reason to bespair
Ready to go through hell
Always know the fate
Morbid addication to pain

DEATHLIKE SILENCE
DEATHLIKE SILENCE

Fortify at a namn abness of deep
Intinite space of human existence
Broken is my lords foul work
Burst rebellious shouts of deads
All accurse by...

DEATHLIKE SILENCE
DEATHLIKE SILENCE

2. Brundish The Sceptre
Mankind can be bind
But not the words of god
Idioms are free and flourish
Ulmight 'cause sensible

BRANDISH THE SCEPTRE
Mistress of all cults
Cursed is your body
Until all severed end nears

Angels force be immortal
In presence of all the true
Stars grow in lonely nights
When the watcher rise

Intelligence awake to harmony
Barious terrible fears
Borrow symbolic mystery
Spiteful eyes in face of beaty

BRANDISH THE SCEPTRE
Monarchist is orbain
BRANDISH THE SCEPTRE
Prestige get paralyse

3. Proselytism Real
Martydom and servitude
Psychosis of a rabid sickless brood
Esoteric dreams a foreign man
Nocturnal flush, frenzied and rude
Buried in a nameless grave
Stand up again the world to save
The fear of darkness and of death
An ormament wedge
Sigh by prophecy
Bestial thought
Drive me in corupt
Hungry belussions
Inseparable huminilty

So man I came with lance and sword
Lead once more the legions of lord
Thrill with lissome lust of light
Come careing out of the night

Ascent to the virceous circle
In an era of fright and terror
A holy document
Hold in hands of unknown
Eradication, opulence
And parish noise
Mephisto the oppressor
Makes me so I like to feel
But I cant believe its true

PROCELYTISM REAL

The day when I arrive the paradies
I flog my horse to the hills of violation
Return in my cenotaph to

PROCELYTISM REAL

4. Equinox
I am that I am the flame
Hidden in a sacred ark
I am the unspoken name
And unbegotten spark
I am that ever goeth
Being myself the way

Supreme for creating words
None but I have ever heard
Emplorer of aeon
Plectren of primal paen

In the sea my father lies
Wept my waters lost forever
Where the waste of moe replieth
Naught nowhere and never
I will shine as he shone
Must go how he has gone

EQUINOX

Fotrh from you and darksome cell
From deep abyss of hell
Coming to view the earth again
See if you can ease distempered brain
Fear and care doth pierce the soul
Hark, how angry furies howl

EQUINOX

For the father and his son
Holy spirits are norm
Male femate quintessential one
Man being veiled in woman form
Glory and worship in the highest
Thou dove mankind that defiest

These my witness and woman
Shall dare the dark agian
Find no sacred ark to swim in
Nemorseless realm of rain

My body wear of empty clasp
Strong as a lion, sharp as an asp
Coat of the flock, I am gold and god
Flesh to thy bone, flow to thy rod
With hoofs of steel I race on the rocks
Through solstice stubborn to

EQUINOX
EQUINOX

5. Obsessed By Cruelty
Delivered from the chains of subjection
Almighty his chivalry urge
Eriled in the crueltys clutch
Strenghed in the believe in himself
Growned with the charm of salomo
Halluzinations and mysterious
Drift him into an inconceivable war

He get stigmated in a holy war
Against apocalyptic mights
Nails claws in his own breast
Eyes so black as night
A red blazed aperture let see
Thee blood filled beating heart

He is an impetuous thundered god
His revenge get cruel
Hateful thought lead him
An almost intolerable sight

With a frightful weight
Demolish christian stamped bodies
Their tears and blood of
Deception and insidiousness
Doze away to the ground
Smash of imperium of
uncontroled religous expansion

Last furious warrior
Pursued by fire
Pack of hound behind him
Mankind hopeless fear

OBSESSED BY CRUELTY
Impalement for destroy
OBSESSED BY CRUELTY
Deadly, cold and grey

After carnage is over grinded bones
Covered the endless battlefield
Broken is the residence
Triumph about innocents boast him
Only unseen nocturnal things let remember
And you know who he is

He is an impetuous thundered god
Ashes to dust behind his ways
Urged by unveiled damnation
Mankind hopeless fear

OBSESSED BY CRUELTY
Inpalement for destroy
OBSESSED BY CRUELTY
Deadly, cold and grey

6. Fall Of Majesty Town
In a realm governed by gods scorn
Absorbed in solitudes deep
Where men and beast are one
Deads disturbed in eternal peace

There is a town of curse
Crueltys bleeding place
Dreadful illumation of lust
Squat behind the gates of proscription

A memorial that never somebody forget
Once by god created and destroyed
Meaned is the majesty town SODOM
Known in all world by reason of force

Fall of majesty town
SODOM and gomorrah
Fire bring it down
Fall of majesty town
A holy place
Deprived by crown

You are residents of evils kingdom
Raise swords in name of satan
Burn all crucifixion
Symbols of wrong oath
Drive lemdness and let em learn the crime
Kill and hate all these which loved you
Use arms of agony and grieve
Follow your leader with incence obedience
Because only known the battles upshot

A memorial that never somebody forget
Once by god created and destroyed
Meaned is the majesty town SODOM
Known in all world by reason of force

[Repeat]

Fall of majesty town
SODOM and gomorrah
Fire bring it down
Fall of majesty town
A holy place
Deprived by crown

The revence came from exception strong power
An indescrible vandalism action
Disperse the place in innumerable bloodspots
Death is unruly and everywhere
Smell of becahed flesh
Controls the occorrence
Feel hudder of hideous inferno
Pray: your thie will be done...
...and in seven days was the town destroyed

7. Nuctemeron
In their unity demons enlogied god
Loose craftiness and scorn
Firesnakes reel around merkurs staff
Lightnings praise let glow in jows sing
Souls return to visit isolated graves
The moment came where circles angulars burn

NUCTEMERON
Lights of darkness
Hour of witchcraft and sorcery
Heavenly shpere voice strike up
NUCTEMERON
High magics memorial
NUCTEMERON
Creators perfection
NUCTEMERON
NUCTEMERON
A fire that gives life to all animate
creatures
Leaded from will clear men
Initates exhault handsand your sorrow get    allayed
Chains of agree let nature square
The key to astronomical leycle for you
Geniens wings move with mysterious voice

Twelve hours implorious
Percieve the strength of genien
And the personify virtue

NUCTEMERON
Lights of darkness
Hour of witchcraft and sorcery
Heavenly shpere voice strike up
NUCTEMERON
High magics memorial
NUCTEMERON
Creators perfection
NUCTEMERON
NUCTEMERON

Carry gods message from one world to another
And the deed of eternal fire is done
Subbdue your bad attributes and
All phantomes of imagination

Understand the harmony of four elemental forces
Hierarchy of occultism lession
Ghosts would beware of great favour

In their power and freedom invincible

8. Pretenders To The Throne
Sitting on a throne of genocide
Our master regal and glory
Subject for suppressions land
Fairness find no place to expand
All his soldiers di to live
In labyrints of death
Buring temples in town of spell
Prepared for damnation to hell

Young blood envoyed
From endless starlight
Behats in right season
For ending the treason

PRETENDERS TO THE THRONE
Betrayed, forgotten and alone
PRETENDERS TO THE THRONE
Our mighty child is born

[Repeat]

You confirm me by oath with magic signs
Possesses from your masterhs brightness
You bring me forms of ever open eyes
Token erect of thorny thigh

In his tyrannical lust
He kills and tortured all who sreams
"In god we trust"
Raise the merciless fight
Against a wird might
Come on, lets overthrow only chance
Change of sovereign is our deliverance

PRETENDERS TO THE THRONE

9. Witchhammer

Hangmans are ready to burst their axes down
They want pull the hammer down to fair wemon

WITCHHAMMER torment bressed ladies
WITCHHAMMER greedy looked eyes
WITCHHAMMER burning souls

Lameing qui te in streets of black death
Terrible monsters, nasty gnomes and mean

The lewness of millions massed
Want pull the hammer down

WITCHHAMMER

10. Volcanic Slut
A queen so old as time
Secret beauty
Under female ruins
Whom she touched run cold
In buring regions
Of her empire
the thriumph about
Life and death

She teached you perversity
From birth til eternity
Every time we want to tug
Unholy VOLCANIC SLUT

Delivered the vibrating cleft
She slides to right and left
Feel her damp walls
Kneads you swollen balls

In wild orgies
She is enslaved to show
Damned and outlawed
Her open wound
Lewd and abnormal
She pleads for fuild of love
Hungry snd insatiable
Hot as fire of vulcano

She teached you perversity
From birth til eternity
Every time we want tug
Unholy VOLCANIC SLUT

Delivered the vibrating cleft
She slides to right and left
Feel her damp walls
Kneads you swollen balls

VOLCANIC SLUT

11. After The Deluge
[1) The Announcement]

It was a time when tyrants ruled the Earth
Mankind's malice showed no remorse
His self created empire troubled him highty
All pursuit of honor was so mighty

A father of three sons, called Noah, appeared
Inspired by God and religious
He shall be rescued from all that wanted flesh
Flying with sons, women, and beasts

[2) ...The beginning... (Invasion of the deluge)]

Noah realized all to the protector's command
Alive on the ground
Fourty days and fourty nights
It shall be rain in the land of promise
On the seventh day heaven's gates get open
Waters covered even great mountains
All what a living odem possessed, died
And got exterminate

[3) Well of deep get clog, rain sink away]

The waters decrease
Noah open the windows of his wooden ark
As the ground dry up he leave the dark
With all the living creatures
Increased by Himself, fulfilled the Earth
Fear and terror turn away

[4) God said:]

I will never more, cursed the Earth
For mankind's will
Their thoughts are evil in their youth
All I've done I repent
So long as Earth lived
Shouldn't stop sowing and crop

Frost and Heat
Summer and Winter
Day and Night

Who spilled human blood
That blood gets spilled by human being

...And Noah realized all
To the protector's command

1. Body Parts
Business of false doctrine
Nothing is impossible
Wonders of technology
We got plastic surgery

Organ trading is of use
Unavoidable the abuse
Need some lungs and need some hearts
Searching for new body parts

Body parts

Bodies damaged after a crash
Transplanting skin to your flesh
That's no minor injury
This is plastic surgery

Rich and infamous bastard
You got a chance to survive
Replacing your diseased parts
Recover and stay alive

Body parts

Life is what you wanna buy
Unknown victims have to die
New organs is what you need
Nothing justified the deed

Business of false doctrine
Everything is possible
Wonders of technology
Because we got plastic surgery

2. Skinned Alive
They curse the day
When I was born
Mentally deranged
Fits of raving madness
Immolate beyond the grave

Celebrate and enjoy
The thrusts with my knife
The way you feel
Is the way you will die
You think you're dead
But you're just skinned alive

I hear you cry
But slow and sure
Your skin will be my toy
Death becomes
Second nature to me
My heart expands with joy

Celebrate and enjoy
The thrusts with my knife
The way you feel
Is the way you will die
You think you're dead
But you're just skinned alive

Liquidation and supreme sacrifice
Deeply afflicted faces
Appetising body odour
Anguish but rest in pieces

Celebrate and enjoy
The thrusts with my knife
The way you feel
Is the way you will die
You think you're dead
But you're just skinned alive

3. One Step Over The Line
At the back of beyond
Where time stands still
In a paradise of love and hate
Like pack of hounds
Invading the land
Girls sell their bodies
Like hot cakes

Unscrupulous deals
With human flesh
To live the life of Riley
Behaving like bulls
In a China chop
Pots of money but nothing to pay

One step over the line
Diseased by genital desire
One step over the line
Out of the frying pan
And into the fire

Perverse bents
Clever camouflage
Holidays of infanticide
Mistress of lust
Sold down the river
Exploited and eaten alive

One step over the line
Diseased by genital desire
One step over the line
Out of the frying pan
And into the fire

Once bitten twice shy
She takes you for a ride
The money she needs to survive
Death defying
Sexual act
Welcome to the club where you die

4. Deadline
Euthanasia or amnesty
Takes you off the ground
Embrace your hopes
And pray to them
When your smile turns upside down

Silent noise in sleepless nights
Freeze your mind and blood
Think about your morbid life
Is there any god?

No postponement
Death by the law
At zero hour
Stops your beating heart

Your days are numbered
Your fate is sealed
When the bell rings twelve o'clock
Waiting for the message
No governor's reprieve
These guys just doing their job

No postponement
Death by the law
At zero hour
Stops your beating heart

You have to live on charity
Not die a natural death
That brings your life so close
Of your own wrongful act

Come on man
It's time to go
Deliverance not so far
TV covered
Millions wait
Tonight you are the star

5. Bullet In The Head
Exploitation of young
Consumer groups
Inspired to say yes
Debasement by
Your mad persuasion
Destroyed while you progress

Bullet in the head
Kick the bucket
Are you prepared?

There is a bullet in your head
To stop the way
You earn your bread

Cold blooded and mendacious
Selling of illusions
Ferocious without remorse
You give them a trip
Like there is no tomorrow
Don't care what H. will cause

Bullet in the head
Kick the bucket
Are you prepared?

There is a bullet in your head
To stop the way
You earn your bread

Suffer the children
Coming to me
Enjoy the habit
The first is free
The best you can get
Between heaven and earth
Nothing ventured
Nothing gained

Bullet in the head
Kick the bucket
Are you prepared?

There is a bullet in your head
To stop the way
You earn your bread

6. The Crippler
Don't believe in rights
There is no such thing
Tearing up the garbage
With pain and suffering

Breaking rules is your desire
You got no sympathy
I'll put you in a wheelchair
That's your penalty

Nothing is secure
Nowhere is safe
Once you cross the line
I will break your spine

The crippler
Broadcast violence
The crippler
Prime time gladiator
The crippler
Bloodsport champion
The crippler
He will take you down

Shattering your kneecaps
The crowd begins to roar
They want more violence
This is a bloody war

Nothing is secure
Nowhere is safe
Once you cross the line
I will break your spine

The crippler
Broadcast violence
The crippler
Prime time gladiator
The crippler
Bloodsport champion
The crippler
He will take you down

Mutilated bodies
Crying out in vain
I will get the trophies
They will not regain

Once you cross the line
I will break your spine

The crippler
Broadcast violence
The crippler
Prime time gladiator
The crippler
Bloodsport champion
The crippler
He will take you down

Adrenaline is pumping
Better you than me
I'm gonna make you bleed
I like brutality

The crippler
Broadcast violence
The crippler
Prime time gladiator
The crippler
Bloodsport champion
The crippler
He will take you down
The crippler
Kicks to the genital
The crippler
Bigfoot in your face
The crippler
Pulling off your fingernails
The crippler
There is no better place

7. Wachturm
Morgens um acht
Mitten in der Nacht
Es klingelt an der Tür
Noch halb im Koma
Das glaubt mir keiner
Da will jemand was von mir
Ich mach mal offen
Was seh ich denn da
'Ne junge Braut nee sogar zwei
Sie wolln die frohe Botschaft verkünden
Mit einer Mark bin ich dabei

Der Wachturm ist die Offenbarung
Für all die Gotteskinder
Packt ihn weg es hat keinen Zweck
Meine Pornos sind mir lieber

Ich lass sie in die Wohnung
Wollt ihr was trinken
'N Kaffee oder Bier
Nein danke wir wollen dich nu bekehren
Nur deshalb sind wir hier
Wir haben gehört
Du bist ein gottloser Mensch
Jehova wird dir verzeihn
Es ist sein Wille und sein Wille geschehe
Wir waschen deine Seele rein

Was für Quatsch
Leck mich am Arsch

Der Wachturm ist die Offenbarung
Für all die Gotteskinder
Packt ihn weg es hat keinen Zweck
Meine Pornos sind mir lieber

Feuer
Und Schwefel
Armageddon
Ist nah

Sie sagen: "Du bist dem Satan verfallen
Und balt kommt das Ende der Welt
Wir können dir helfen
Komm mit uns und opfere dein Geld"
Hört mal Mädels
Ich schlag euch was for
Denn der Quatsch geht mich auf die Eier
Wir trink'n erstmal einen
Ihr zieht euch aus
Und wir machen 'nen flotten Drei

Komm wir fucken
Komm fir fucken

Der Wachturm

8. Tapping The Vein
Armed and ready I sit in a room
Vanishing power
A sting in my arm
Blood pours on the floor
Final hour
The one that got me out of the grave
Always there
Don't know what he's aiming at
Do not dare

Never regain...
Tapping the vein

Darkness all around me
I can't see
A door that's never really open
Not for me
The shock of recognition now
I will die
Mind distortion weird thoughts
Tell me why...

I'm going insane...
Tapping the vein

Still got my gun my only friend
Through it all
Can't pull the trigger no final shot
Can't you hear my call?
Venomous poison lethal liquid
Pumping through my veins
Physical destruction
Psychic interruption
Dying brain

Never regain...
Tapping the vein

9. Back To War
The end of armistice
And universal peace
No suspension
Of hostilities
Prophecy of bad news
This is no fun
Come into your own
And take off your gun
The enemy behind
Like an awful drag
You'd better have eyes
In the back of your head
Move into position
Put up a good fight
Don't forget the sleeping pills
A kind of suicide

Forget the rules
Forget the odds
Protect your own
War is guts

Back to war

You will be wrapped up
In your assiduous work
Offer your service
To clean up the world
The hostile scum
If looks could kill
Contact with the enemy
That you will feel
Centered on you
Touch and go
Put up with the pain
Await the blow
Fix them for what
They've done to you
Don't fall into line
Don't care what you do

Forget the rules
Forget the odds
Protect your own
War is guts

Back to war

War of independence
Don't beat a retreat
Combative in
The seasoned league
You are sure
Of your success
Never shut the eyes
To the horrible facts
Revolution and cowardice
To get the might
Never let them
Out of your sight
When you fall on the field
They'll bring you home
To the peaceful place
Where you were born

Forget the rules
Forget the odds
Protect your own
War is guts

Back to war

10. Hunting Season
I was granted no quarter
Because you forgot the rules
The words I said are
Sure to come true
Your empty promises
Treacherous and blind
Your deceitful lies call
The war back to my mind

I learnt a way to survive
The enemy to neutralise
They got no reason
Hunting season

I want to set the world on fire
Like a savage beast - A final desire
I burn my boats surrounded by danger
A soldier in hiding kicked out like a stranger

I learnt a way to survive
The enemy to neutralise
They got no reason
Hunting season

I avail every chance
It's a pleasure for me
To slay one by one
To fight for liberty
Once a lieutenant in higher service
Now I'm nothing
A man without mercy

I learnt a way to survive
The enemy to neutralise
They got no reason
Hunting season

I want to set the world on fire
Like a savage beast - A final desire
I burn my boats surrounded by danger
A soldier in hiding kicked out like a stranger

I learnt a way to survive
The enemy to neutralise
They got no reason
Hunting season

11. Reincarnation
Life on earth for you to know
In peace you live in peace you will go
Behind the scenes of salvation
Nobody knows lust and temptation

The mass begins the spirit appears
The man in black nothing he fears
A fatal disguise is what you call holy
Where is god? I want you to show me.

In the name of the father the son
The holy spirit the show has begun
Thy kingdom come thy will be done
Hallowed be thy name

Reincarnation
False celebration
Reincarnation
Mental subordination

Go down on your knees
And pray for peace
Join the club of total devotion
Religious faith and social failure
Once you've been trapped
Death is your saviour

In the name of the father the son
The holy spirit the show has begun
Thy kingdom come thy will be done
Hallowed be thy name

Reincarnation
False celebration
Reincarnation
Mental subordination

In the name of the father the son
The holy spirit the show has begun
Thy kingdom come thy will be done
Hallowed be thy name

Reincarnation
False celebration
Reincarnation
Mental subordination

1. Frozen Screams
Sexual urge
Unleashed energy
Repressed for so many years
No more continence
Dreams of smashing
Let ablaze this dark abyss
The fruits of my life
So fully developed
Burned up to a crisp
Hatred turns to apathy
But now the beggar changed into a king

I cannot hear the frozen screams
My mind feels so much flattered
I taste the blood so warm and sweet
A mournful desirous charade

Playing with my sensual toy
I see it down below
My fingers touched the creature's neck
Seduced me to move on
My plans get true without repent
For whom I shed a tear?
You have to pay the righteous price
'til I get jailed again

2. Fuck The Police
New age rebellion - anarchy
Intoxicated with injustice of law
Sneaking lives - mental decay
Practicise subversive dirty needs
No acts of grace - stand up and fight
You are their slave but never questioned why
Born on your knees - don't give a shit
You are remote controlled but who is to blame

Fuck the police

Blaze of anger - deaf and blind
The enemy that overshadows us all
Out of control - disrooted minds
The final judgement and the final day will come
Too much pressure - to much power
Until the point of no return
Interwar period - martial games
To find out what they try to ignore

Eternal lies - visions of change
When the dreams of freedom awake
Methods of greed - bleeding hearts
An easy target for the one with the gun
Empty promises - better left unsaid
Illusions shattered by mendacity and hate
Supremacy - hungry to kill
No more effectual fervent supplication

3. Gisela
Es wird nie mehr so sein wie es früher einmal war
Der zauber ist verflogen denn sie ist nicht mehr da
Nur sie war für mich immer eine kleine sünde wert
Doch sie wollte nur das eine und ich hab's zu spät gemerkt

Und eines tages stand geschrieben in einem pornoheft
"gisela, 40 stark behaart sucht nicht nur herren von welt
Auch du mein freund, der dieses liest kennst du schon das paradies?
Wenn nicht, dann komm zu gisela, denn ich bin immer für dich da"

"ich weiss du magst gern kaviar
Ich weiss du liebst den sekt
Bei mir bekommst du alles
Auf einem silbernen tablett
Was immer du auch denkst von mir
Ich glaube du hast recht
Was immer du von mir verlangst
Dein wunsch ist mir befehl"

4. That's What An Unknown Killer Diarised
Tides of burning blood upon my face
Caressing my soul like a sweet embrace
Passionate, secret and profound
Gleaming eyes of uncharitable love

Shuffling out of mental claws to find a resort
Champagne of desire still oozing from my pores
I cannot resist the guileful brightness in your eyes
And your body with limbs that drags behind

Affectionated wantoness so give me your hand
Never weeping over victims never feeling bad
Inflaming the wish to control your breath
Sequestration from life, conveyance to death

I know that I am guilty but devoutness diarized
God-awful desecration, psychotic homicide
Discovered is my preference for lacerated skin
I hope that rotten bodies don't get buried so deep

That's what an unknown killer diarized

My spirit is casting the pure part of the one
Who brings fatal calamites still before the dawn
I never before felt a kind of compunction
My life is inspired by endless temptation

The day when I'm snatched away from this ground
And veins are exhausted by my bleeding heart
I consider to reap now the fruits of death
Retire with pride to write down my adventures

She followed me trustfully
But wondered where we'd go
I led her to the hidden place
That she had never seen before
My sweet heart

5. Hanging Judge
This is the hour of the savage guns
Beyond the pale and beyond the sun
Ganged up with jesse by the mating call of gold
Side by side fighting not changing the course

The code of law in the hand of the one
Who drags you to the hanging tree
Bloodhounds in the hands of those
Who will have to bleed

Haging judge
He is the law
Hanging judge
You are in his claws
Hanging judge
The trapdoor will fall
Hanging judge

Bullets for breakfast and dust to breathe
To be on the point to strike down all the wimps
Killing the riders of the whistling pine
By each wardrum beat someone will die

The wild bunch riding wings of hawks
Red painted deserts where you broke the law
Your facedown life ain't so much of a pity
Against the fools and against the glory

6. No Way Out
Your touch is like a snakebite kiss
Your love is like a boon
A leader in my haggard dreams
Emotions of a fool

No way out

I'm spoiling you with my prurience
My sadness disappears
The way you told me beside stories
Still pleasant to my ears

A willing and addictive girl
Wide open legs so tempting
The gleeming of her greedy eyes
Seduced me to come back

Your touch was like a snakebite kiss
Your love was like a boon
The leader in my haggard dreams
He passes me the gun

7. Polytoximaniac
I'm quite prepared to use what everyone declines
I can't restrained myself
'cause devils in my head tonight
Dullness in my eyes turns all the sunshine into rain
And I deceive myself that I could never fall again

I'm a polytoximaniac
Dangerous and blind
A polytoximaniac
The truth begins to bite
A polytoximaniac
It's all that I can say
A polytoximaniac
From birth 'til my decay

It's not a strong man's act to fall in ecstasy
I like to have a bit of fun also with medicine
I blow my brain out of my head but I don't care
Searching for a secret flavour restless day by day

Sometimes I see reflections in the shade of god
One billion cockroaches are ready to attack
I can't believe my sense it's time to sat goodbye
The golden shot is due, erasure of my mind

8. 'Til Death Do Us Unite
I feel a rifle bullet bore into my heart
A sudden impact shock that stops my pulsing blood
I see the glory shining light of paradise
And insincerities, forever left behind

'til death do us unite

I see the mournful flowers fading on my grave
And all my friends are crying to god my soul to save
Hateful faces spitting on my last resting place
And all my foes are praying to hell my mind to take

I hear the echos of your prayers and your lies
Your falseness and your greed mendacious sorry sights
My hopes are buried by my broken dignity
Still god will bless and curse us all
To all eternity

9. Hazy Shade Of Winter
Time,
Time,
Time, see what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities.

I was so hard to please.
Look around,
Leaves are brown,
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.

Hear the salvation army band.
Down by the riverside's
Bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned.

Carry your cup in your hand.
And look around.
Leaves are brown.
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.

Hang on to your hopes, my friend.
That's an easy thing to say,
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build the m again.
Look around,
The grass is high,
The fields are ripe,
It's the springtime of my life.

Seasons change with the scenery;
Weaving time in a tapestry.
Won't you stop and remember me

At any convenient time?
Funny how my memory skips
Looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme.

Drinking my vodka and lime,
I look around,
Leaves are brown,
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter.

10. Suicidal Justice
Show them that you are the master of carnal desire
Confusion in their hateful eyes when they call you a liar
You cannot suppress the reflection of hate and rebirth
With all your strength of you will to escape from this earth

Suicidal justice
Collective instinct of death
Suicidal justice
A war of a man life to waste

This will be the first and the last act inside of your mind
It's useless to save yourself and don't try to hide
You got a message to kill from a higher place
The horrors of war switched off your brain
Take revenge!

You see them on hands and on knees when they crawl from their holes
You've never before seen a life fading so slow this is the time to go
Come on kiss the ground castration of cowards
And feeding the balls to the hounds

11. Wander In The Valley
On your knees
Praying at the burial ground
Mistrustful eyes of intimacy
Pointing the way to the other side
You hear the screams of a million souls
Unguarded and left to their own resources
Where time turned into a frozen block
And even the water of life

You will die!

Wander in the valley

As you reach for the sky
With hollow shells of faded dreams
Time bomb ticking has just begun
To make reprisals on what I have done
Like grains of sand that fall from my hand
The fate I feel is drawing near
Shackles in my brain losing so fast
Waiting to unfold

Mummified bodies
Elixir of life wasting away
Perpetual glares of those who are delivered
Entomber in the derbis of honour and blood
A sinful voice that prophesied
Death becomes easy just close your eyes
Incantation of freedom so urgent and true
Your wish is my command

12. Sow The Seeds Of Discord
Incubation of a mental disease
Transpiration of a spiteful liquid
Coming to terms with the devil
Threatening like the reaper in a saddle

You sow the seeds of discord
You'll reap the fruits of death

He learned to dominate the gamesmanship of war
An outrage, cynic for use all
You are a rusty nail in our coffin
The world's reminding exibition

One man's meat is another ones poison
So kill yourself with tears of joy
We'll never accept to bite the dist like this
Got a mighty weapon to defend us

13. Master Of Disguise
Unnatural caresses of a man without remorse
He didn't realize the fact that love can't be commanded
Confusion and depravity, rituals of death
Memories linger in his brain; dreams in a bed of nails

Possessed by all the souvenirs
Possessed by crying children
Spreading madness kile disease
Near death experience

Master of disguise

A dirty smile is integrate into killer's face
Bloodshot eyes stare resolutely, watch the victim's race
Welcome to the surgery; hearts will be removed
Raping to find satisfaction; posing like a dog

Hidden deep inside

When the flame of life grows cold and every lie is true
Ride the wings of sacrifice but never play the fool
Incarnation of the evil one; crushing skulls and bones
You don't belong to the human race
No mercy for your soul

14. Schwerter Zu Pflugscharen
Mit stiefeln hast du mich getreten
Wie ein wolf auf mich gelauert
Ich war dir hilflos ausgeliefert
Hast meine würde mir geraubt
Um gnade liessest du mich winseln
Zu oft den tod mir prophezeit
Niemals werd' ich den frieden finden
Voller hass und leid

Die peitsche musst' ich täglich spüren
Und auch den dolch in meinem leib
Die spritzen die mich so sehr quälten
Das gift in mir für alle zeit
Heute noch fühle ich die schmerzen
Dein geist verfolgt mich tag und nacht
Und niemals werd' ich frieden finden
Ein krüppel voller leid und hass

Schwerter zu pflugscharen

Verdunkelt hast du mir die augen
Mein rückrat mir gebrochen
Die wunden tief in meinem innern
Werden niemals heilen
Du bist die ausgeburt der hälle
Gezeugt von denen die geschwiegen
Und die, die all den wind gesät
Werden sturm ernten

Doch irgendwann werd' ich dich finden
Egal wo du dich auch versteckst
Du wirst vor mir zu kreuze kriechen
Dein blut, es wird mir schmecken
Und erst wenn du begraben bist
In der erde der gerechtigkeit
Dann erst kann ich frieden finden
Bis in alle ewigkeit...

15. Hey, Hey, Hey Rock'N'Roll Star
I wanna be a rock'n roll star
I wanna be the one who plays an ace guitar
In every town I want to get my drinks for free
And thousand girls will cry when I have to leave

Hey, hey, hey rock'n roll star

I wanna be the one with preference to fuck
A heavy metal gentleman rising out of ruck
I am so nimble-fingered, rubbing strings so fast
Also between your maiden girlfriends legs

I'll surely never get reduced to penury
Like a poor wretch who's rock'n rolling in money
My childhood dreams, now reality
Until another bastard gets bigger than me
