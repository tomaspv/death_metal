1. Innocence And Wrath
[Instrumental]

2. Jewel Throne
Once prayed to my gods, searching for the whistled memories
Empty eyes are staring now, to my feet a land of sorrow
I'm the king, sitting in the dark hiding from the shadows of the wind
Wafts of might, wine of fire, I was called to taste

Silver horses brought us here, to the edge of the universe
We left the falling walls as the stars' collapse began
Now I rest on the highest steps, revealed the eternal frontier
As I gaze from the Jewel Throne to the portal of infinity

Fallen have the "chosen ones", debris remain in the dust
Far behind, beyond the sands, the wind sings to those who fell
Forever now, my hands laid down the weapons
I will pray to my gods, searching for the memories

3. The Usurper
Lend me your steel-bearing hand
So I may reign the Jewel Throne
My soul feels the gods' demand
As the lost kings uphold my side

Blood and sand
Mark their way
The usurper's tears
Guide my sword...

Fantasia slept in my thoughts
As I was a son of infinity
The emperor, forgotten, rests in my dreams
As, back to the wall, I start my conquest

Blood and sand
Mark their way
The usurper's tears
Guide my sword...

Innocence and wrath
Now lie far beyond
As we cross the deserts
To reach the fortress' gates

Tragic serenades
Are whispered in the wind
As eyes in fury
Grant us our strength

(They're) throning on the dignity of might
But the successor is to enter the hall
False truth saw them climbing the steps
But I remain the Jewel Throne's choice

Blood and sand
Mark their way
The usurper's tears
Guide my sword...

4. Dawn Of Megiddo
Humilated in human form/We have to die to be reborn
Awaiting the final judgement/The dawn now lifts
Subjects of flesh/Slaves of lust
The cross has failed/You won't see the coming fall

A diviner's fire and soil
Flames, like flowers, like blood
Fires of freedom, flowers of doom
A surface of hateful hope

[Chorus]
Oh subjects of pain
Lovers of death
You will feel
The yearning flames

Flames like tongues - like cries
Pant for kisses - For bites
Seven steps - And we're one
Humilated - In human thoughts

The frost, it bites/Your inner heart
Frozens the flame/ln every eye
The lord will come/Broken ice
The fire will burn/Gleaming ways

Well never be reborn
Prenatal death's redeemed (our lives)
(Into his hand) we demand our hearts
The lord and we are one

5. Eternal Summer
The pyramids tremble, darken the sun, (the) sky tums red
They reached the wall of no return (and the) breeze has stopped
Who wore the crown will never be known - might is broken
For all we'll drown into the sand - what will remain?

Inverted horizons, denied truth and blinded eyes
The Titans arise, the monuments fall, we cannot halt
Wishful pleads at last came true, some always knew
The clouds burn - or is it fire? ... the gods wince

Human pride and megalomania - The Titans watched it all
The trace led to nowhere - Wrath had to come
As ushers at the gates - To ecstasy and excess
AII turn their backs - They won't give us any rest

(The) fires won't redeem, illuminated's the night - the eternal summer
When they came high from the sphere on shrieking wings ...
Now they're trapped to the ground, to heat and dust
And the eye is glowing above ...

6. Circle Of The Tyrants
After the battle is over
And the sands drunken the blood
All what there remains
Is the bitterness of delusion

The immortality of the gods
Sits at their side
As they leave the walls behind
To reach the jewels gleam

The days have come
When the steel will rule
And upon his head
A crown of gold

Your hand wields the might
The tyrant's the precursor
You carry the will
As the morning is near

I sing the ballads
Of victory and defeat
I hear the tales
Of frozen mystery

The new kingdoms rise
By the circle of the tyrants
In the land of darkness
The warrior, that was me
Grotesque glory
None will (ever) see them fall
And hunts and war
Are like everlasting shadows

Where the winds cannot reach
The tyrant's might was born
And often I look back
With tears in my eyes
Grotesque glory
None will (ever) see them fall
And hunts and wars
Are like everlasting shadows

7. (Beyond The) North Winds
On days of northern wind, (past) illusions surround my dreams
Drops of mute oceans breath in the palm of my hand
The sound of silent waves still caresses all my thoughts
Where warm, mystic floods dominated the upper hemisphere

[Chorus]
(And) dark ships sailed beyond those lost realms
Through gates to eternity, above the sleeping mind

Forever inconquerable seemed the walls of time
To those who always feared and always fled the dawn
But then, the guardians growl invited the thirst for steeI
Part god, part man, if I walked by their side

The old man's dream now has ended much too soon
Forgotten rests the wisdom that brought them once so far
Vanished until rebirth, we sleep the endless sleep
For one who knows never tries to reappear ...

8. Fainted Eyes
Try to see through fainted views
As reality disappears in haze
A journey between eternal walls ...

The senses unfold before my eyes
As the endless dreams begin to reign
And my hands slip off the edge

[Chorus]
The waters grow dumb
While they descend (behind)
Fainted eyes

Drifting in the streams of wisdom
While recognizing all those banal tales
Sin beyond truth, (I see) glimmering splinters

Encountering my past in flickering whispers
While they drown behind their frontiers
And the rulers sink in agony

Fallacy and false idols
Unbelievable is the human direction
But the screams die away in the distance

Try to see through fainted views
But the dust still covers all my dreams
I wouldn't tell you anyway ...

9. Tears In A Prophet's Dream
[Instrumental]

10. Necromantical Screams
Necromantical screams.
Only you are deaf.
Is there life beyond death?

You've entreated death. The answer will come.
Debris of faith. Even you are false.
Immortal morals. Caught up in time.
Vault of darkness. Filled with hate.

[Chorus]
Deny life. Addiction to death.
Procession of damnation. Expulsion of light.
Hazardous ways. Into the rush.
Soul is frozen and flesh is weak.

Necromantical screams.
Only you are deaf.
Intelligence is mute.

Respect and thoughts. Buried long ago.
Pleading for the end. Blind and dumb.
We won't feel. There could be more.
I will remain alone in the dark

... only you are deaf

* album: "Vanity / Nemesis" (1990) *
************************************

1. The Heart Beneath
Heaven carries not
What the soul would reap
Growth of deception
Lined between the weeps
A thousand lusts luring in the heart
A desire in our sleep Nemesis
A million lies striving to be shared
Escaping mindless leapsereos
An afterthought formed
First among fallen idols
Of the pandemonial storm
The heart beneath, the desire to die
Scepters of Scarlet, the eternal lie
Tormented eyes, perceiving relief
The shadow's light won't disappear
The mist reveals the shades of grief
The heart beneath, inside my fear

2. Wine In My Hand
They're sleeping through the ages
Faces bare of names
Remembrance ever lies
At the Bosom of the insane
Death's cold embrace
Across the restless seas
Unfolding the wish to forget
The eyes of the deceased
Thirst for the wine in my hand
Third from the sun
The heart of death
A thought for fake desires
Starving trough the night
Engulfed in an earthbound fire
Left all alone among the dances and cries
They seed all the hate
Within the shade of sights

3. Wings Of Solitude
I'm sensing the paleness of lies
No rest to caress their eyes
In visions enthroning sleep
A mistress of eternal weep
Wastelands against the night
Bound in chains, a wish for light
Wandering beneath my fate my body slowly pales
Unleashed, with hands that cannot reach
The screams of heaven and shores
The sleep - sound of a shadowed search
Foresee the wings of solitude
The wings of solitude
Ages of bleeding in vain
Entrapped by the whine of the insane
Civilization - a vision of deceit
Misfits, emerged from the heat
The violet dances fade
Restless dreams of hate and a silent cry
Wastelands against the night
Bound in chains a wish for light
Wandering beneath my fate
My body slowly pales

4. The Name Of My Bride
Burning in a hell made of my own
Looking for the you I once knew
Your love is hanging over me
Like a big black cloud of misery
Oh mother I beg of you to set me free
Now, like the tempting snake of old
She has seduced my very soul
She took my rib she stole my heart
And hid it in her bosom's warmth
Oh mother hallowed be thy name
For u give birth to us in pain
Maybe I'm Adam with a paradise lost
Or maybe I'm Abel, maybe I'm not
But as sure as hell I know that I'll be chain
Wasting love and my life again
Oh woman of sorrow, you guide me on
into caverns, where I do not belong
Out of your womb, onto the earth
Oh mother of my life, please give me birth
Oh mother of pain, please let me go
For you must reap what you have sown
Oh mother, my mother yes I know
The name of my bride is sorrow

5. This Island Earth
[originally by Bryan Ferry]So I send an SOS semaphore myself catch me falling finally through the air and underground
Everywhere this sound screams whisper I can’t breathe I feel it in my bones though I know I'm not alone.
You’re spinning far too far from me so cruel to be so kind now I know I’ll always find this island earth.

A mystery as I stumble through the dark dream lovers dream apart starry eyed a vision rushes in do I wonder or care.
My spirit is bleeding God knows where a never ending stream I tried to love tried to find my soul in shadows running blind.
Restless as the sea.
Via side-walks through the haze wandering as in a maze lost in number time and space.
So near and yet so far castaway as strangers are this island earth and you and me

6. The Restless Seas
Traces of dew, eyes in disbelief
Did we persist in misery and grief
Tasting a glance of the bold
A thousand days of fates untold
And from the restless seas I'm born
Through pain and in the restless seas I drown
Love in vain
Cold embrace
Regresses from mankind's trace
Ruling the light, we gave our lonely hearts
Addicted fiends, through weakened weeps and woes
The sight of fear, trading in for faith
Eternal thirst to lead the circling hate
Traces of dew, eyes in disbelief
Shattered at base, the lies that we breathe

7. Phallic Tantrum
No more... Harassed Hearts Primeval wings of solitude
The cross has saved the soil
Traces given to sinister moods
Cavity of hate
Unborn faith, scorn beneath
The quest for death
Gold built the mortal feat
Into the phallic tantrum
Stronghold of eternal fear
Into the phallic tantrum
Their only wish... to reappear
Infinite space
No dreams of sleep of death
Humane, cold embrace
Concepts of might and reign
The apocalyptic raids
Shadows over the hearts beneath
Calls that forever fade
Their visions betrayed

8. A Kiss Or A Whisper
By masquerade of sleep madness ever lures
Resting soul's rebirth, denying the depths of fear
Necropolis Built from mortal bones
Death descends inside the darkened mind
A thousand cries in pain, spread beneath the fall
A kiss glowing above, feeding upon the heart
Spells... on glory they ride from within
Light, as they seed hate onto the path
A kiss or a whisper
Floods of hate without relief for all sinister sleep
Shadows of eternal belief

9. Vanity
Deep within my bleeding heart
Stranded by the hold of fear
Agony takes a final role
Sipping the dew of tears
Thorns and rites idols of false
Tearing apart the skin of lust
Forever still but never born
Broken by the final quest
Vanity, silent choir spreading lies
Vanity, fallen shrine of muted sighs
Surrender, dance and cry
Their Tormented eyes perceive
Grasps of fright, lusters crawl
Tarnished grounds of faded beliefs

10. Nemesis
Heaven and shores
Beneath the death of the sun
Suffering at will
Slaves in the cavity of doom
Wastelands without winds
Cries cut through the lies
The heat of the deserts
Heart closes to my throat
Will death cleanse me of this nemesis
I taste the blood and all the pain
In darkened depths
A vision of fear becomes as real
Nursing the dead
No love, life is grief
Dare to escape
The claws of sleep of death
No good, no cold
Salvation we are praying for
Days full of fear The silent eyes perceive
Will death cleanse me of this nemesis
I taste the blood and all the pain

11. Heroes
[Originally performed by David Bowie]

I will be king
And you
You will be queen
Though nothing will
Drive them away
We can beat them
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
Just for one day

And you
You can be mean
And I
I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers
And that is a fact
Yes we're lovers
And that is that

Though nothing
Will keep us together
We could steal time
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
For ever and ever
What d'you say

I
I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins
Like dolphins can swim

Though nothing
Will keep us together
We can beat them
For ever and ever
Oh we can be Heroes
Just for one day

I
I will be king
And you
You will be queen
Though nothing
Will drive them away
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be us
Just for one day

I
I can remember
Standing
By the wall
And the guns
Shot above our heads
And we kissed
As though nothing could fall
And the shame
Was on the other side
Oh we can beat them
For ever and ever
Then we can be Heroes

Just for one day

We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be Heroes
We're nothing
And nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying
Then you better not stay
But we could be safer
Just for one day

******************************************************

1. Idols Of Chagrin
What kind of race, lack of direction
Just how lunatic, to have a nature so deceit
Bewail my reverie, a gambol untried
Lure of carnality and silence in forfeit
Animals, enslaved to pearls of fictionalized worth
Creatures, born from caves into simulated mirth

I'm talking, Idols of Chagrin
Born of posession, complacement in disguise

Craving and candid, as to defy the character's fall
The kisses you drain, pedestrian pedigree
What's thought is pain might be desire after all

2. A Descent To Babylon (Babylon Asleep)
Babylon asleep, an everlasting foe
Striving to hurt, for flesh becomes dirt
Resting within, the sacred fire
I can't withold, the lies untold

Dances and cries, a descent to babylon
Wine in my hand, a descent to babylon

All eyes must foul, in stench of fear
Killing to quench, Babylon's tears

We are wisphering for holy wine
Innocence to reign, a world of shrines

This crazy dream, raging over ages
For only one belief. Killing - Suffer for a thought
In human blood, stretched out

A descent to a 1000 deaths
As sweet as snow, as cold as dew
A descent to a 1000 deaths.
Babylon asleep

3. Return To The Eve
Dreaming eyes, hope to return
As shadows fall, onto distorted paths
Delivered from the fetters of light
Drifting back to my reality
Subconscious depreates the day
In the twilight of my own intellect
Dull is my mind, Captive of illusion
Remain awake, Is just dust!
(.."Take my soul away into the dark, dreaming 1000 morbid dreams, no tomorrow
when the wind caresses my mind, could I ever return..it would be my Doom..")
Obsessed by the nightmare's sound
Drifting back into the realms of chaos
Reality has become my dream
I'll be covered by the abyss ground
..Endless fall, Memories in the light
frontiers of chaos, Return to the EVE...

4. Juices Like Wine
Thirst and desire, to rule the light
For crossing heavens, a futile fight
Bound to storm, our minds wave
Fervent to sail in deserts of mist

Juices like wine, like the blood in the sands
Juices like wine

Born of earth, we strive for skies
Obsessed with lies, in arms of sleep
Earning dreams, we blind our eyes
Challenging secrets, ancient the cries

Juices like wine, like the blood in the sands
Juices like wine

5. The Inevitable Factor
I stalk alone the burried seas
Dead and white, weak memories
Below 0, I'm turning blue
Why does the ice burn so hot

Frozen waters, a strange land
I know I live, as the frost bites

My eyes are closed, but I can't sleep
Moving forward, for sleep means death
A white shroud covers me
I buried myself to stay alive

Time's passing slow on my pale face
Beneath the snow, beneath the ice

I stalk alone the burried seas
Dead and white, weak memories

6. The Hearth Beneath

7. Cherry Orchards
Dancing violet dreams.
Joining nights of satin fame.
Acting jewel games.
All forgiven, you streak my heart.
More than pleasure in ice cold flames.
Crying soft, as love flies tame.
Swelling tears in diaries of lies.
Fading lights, as songs die quiet.
Bleeding sweet for dying blind.
Masking fears of silent decline.

Cherry Orchards. Ginger looks upon pain.
Cherry Orchards. August fades like tears in vain.

Winter's final shine. Dressing gold, one last time.
Seep from lace. Roses for an unborn face.

Cherry Orchards. Ginger looks upon pain.
Cherry Orchards. August fades like tears in vain.

8. Tristesses De La Lune

9. Wings Of Solitude

10. The Usurper
Lend me your steel-bearing hand
So I may reign the Jewel Throne
My soul feels the gods' demand
As the lost kings uphold my side

[Chorus]
Blood and sand
Mark their way
The usurper's tears
Guide my sword...

Fantasia slept in my thoughts
As I was a son of infinity
The emperor, forgotten, rests in my dreams
As, back to the wall, I start the conquest

Innocence and wrath
Now lie far beyond
As we cross the deserts
To reach the fortress' gates

Tragical serenades
Are whispered in the wind
As eyes in fury
Grant us our strength

(They're) throning on the dignity of might
But the successor is to enter the hall
False truth saw them climbing the steps
But I remain the Jewel Throne's choice

11. Journey Into Fear

12. Downtown Hanoi
Four arc lights. Moving stealth.
Two ride up north. Into the barrel fear.
Desire to share. My valiant care.
Downtown Hanoi.

We are drowning in purple wine.
Standing as one, as one we line.
Gold and light did stop their dance.
A fever obscene, a wicked romance.

I'm tasting sweat on my tongue.
Fane of wicked green.
Faith to the heart.
Passion and death.
Downtown's breath.

13. Circle Of The Tyrants
After the battle is over
And the sands drunken the blood
All what there remains
Is the bitterness of delusion

The immortality of the gods
Sits at their side
As they leave the walls behind
To reach the jewels gleam

The days have come
When the steel will rule
And upon his head
A crown of gold

Your hand wields the might
The tyrant's the precursor
You carry the will
As the morning is near

I sing the ballads
Of victory and defeat
I hear the tales
Of frozen mystery

The new kingdoms rise 
By the circle of the tyrants
In the land of darkness 
The warrior, that was me
Grotesque glory 
None will (ever) see them fall
And hunts and war 
Are like everlasting shadows

Where the winds cannot reach 
The tyrant's might was born
And often I look back 
With tears in my eyes
Grotesque glory 
None will (ever) see them fall
And hunts and wars 
Are like everlasting shadows

14. In The Chapel In The Moonlight

15. I Won't Dance
I did taste their only dream
As denial was still unborn
Secrets beyond those dethroned walls
And echoes of a martyr's scream
Deterrent vibrates the allurements face
As my barque drowns toward conquest

Don't quieten the elder's tears
For they've forseen our past
Covered lies our remembrance
As symbols turn to dust

I won't dance
I won't dance
I won't dance within despair
I won't dance
The elder's orient

Journey lnto a wicked world
My body beneath the skies
Erotic wishes, my heart has failed
Incalculable is the surface's breath
Paralyzed form - the ring of death
Steps on the stairs to my silent ecstasy

Caress of the mental space
Thrones of fake life
Eternal addiction towards those eyes
(Gods) didn't you believe my earthbound call?
Slipping into the hidden sun
Intoxicated by an endless fall

16. The Name Of My Bride

17. Mexican Radio
[written by Wall of Voodoo, from their album Call of the West]
[correlated with the cover by Celtic Frost from the album Into the Pandemonium]

I feel a hot wind on my shoulder
And the touch of a world that's older
Turn the switch and check the number
Leave it on, in bed I slumber

Hear the rhythm of the music
Buy the product, never use it
Hear the talking of the DJ
Can't understand, what's he say?

I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio

Dial it in, tune the station
They talk about U.S. inflation
I understand just a little
No comprende - it's a riddle

I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio

Wish I was in Tijuana -
Eating barbecued iguana
I'd take requests on the telephone
I'm on a wavelength far from home

I feel the hot wind on my shoulder
I dial in, south of the border
Hear the talking of the DJ -
Can't understand, what's he say?

I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio

Radio
Radio
Radio
What does he say?

I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio ...

18. Under Upollyon's Sun
The face of Nemesis
Under pandemonium's heat
Parched my yearning whisper
In this world of deceit

To lie, to cry, they die
To drown in their well of sighs
All their pain bears their name
Ignorance dies by its own lies

Tears of indignation
Crying under Apollyon's sun
In faith for love
Underground, a dream apart

Flesh from soil
Disparate, no less the same
Sift my tears
The lasting spring

We were raised to fade
To deluge by carnal claims

To lie, to cry, they die
To drown in their well of sighs
